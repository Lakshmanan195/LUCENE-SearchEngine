It is the only fighter with the capabilities necessary to counter current and future threats. Germany’s C-130s have a special place in Hercules history as Germany’s Luftwaffe and France’s Armée de l'Air operate the first bi-national C-130 squadron out of Évreux-Fauville Air Base in Normandy, France. SPY-7 is the world’s most advanced, powerful and versatile radar. It can track more targets across longer ranges than any existing radar, keeping you safe at home and abroad. Our CMS 330 is a tested, fielded, exported and in-service next generation Combat Management System originally developed for the Royal Canadian Navy, and proven in Canadian, International and NATO maritime operations. The F-35 will replace Germany’s aging fleet of PA-200 Tornados by 2030. In facing rising conflicts overseas, the F-35 stands ready as the lowest cost solution for the German Air Force, and it is the only fighter with the capabilities necessary to counter current and future threats. This decision is another step forward in growing our partnership with Germany and expanding the European F-35 footprint. Today, there are approximately 120 F-35s in Europe across six countries. By the 2030s, we expect over 500 F-35s will integrate from more than 10 European countries, including two full U.S. F-35 squadrons at RAF Lakenheath. The C-130J Super Hercules is one of the world’s most proven and powerful tactical transport aircraft, with more than 500 aircraft delivered to over 22 global customers and more than 2 million flight hours obtained. The Bundeswehr operates total of six C-130Js with a focus on national risk and crisis management as well as special forces support. The C-130J fleet includes three aircraft in the KC-130 tanker configuration, which ensures air and ground refueling capability. The German aircraft are based at the French airbase Évreux-Fauville in Normandy, being operated as part of a Franco-German air transport squadron and a total fleet of ten Lockheed Martin Super Hercules. The Aegis Combat System is the most modern surface combat system with demonstrated and deployed capabilities to defend against advanced air and surface threats. It was designed as a complete system: the missile launching element, the computer programs, the radar and the displays which are fully integrated to work together. Aegis provides ballistic missile and hypersonic missile defense as well, and is the only naval system integrated and interchangeable with new and developing missiles (such as hypersonic Glide Phase Interceptor) to continue to advance its capabilities to outpace ever-evolving threats while performing new missions A modern, flexible and scalable solution supporting all missions, CMS 330 technology delivers operational efficiencies by seamlessly connecting systems and people; powering smarter, faster decisions that outpace complex threats in an evolving operational environment.

SPY-7 ist das modernste, leistungsfähigste und vielseitigste Radar der Welt. Es kann mehr Ziele über große Entfernungen erfassen als jedes andere verfügbare Radar und sorgt damit für mehr Sicherheit im Inland sowie im Einsatz. Unser CMS 330 ist ein für den Einsatz geprüftes, exportiertes Führungs- und Waffeneinsatzsystem der nächsten Generation, das ursprünglich für die Royal Canadian Navy entwickelt wurde und sich in kanadischen, internationalen und NATO-Marineoperationen bewährt hat. Die F-35 steht als kostengünstigste Lösung für die deutsche Luftwaffe bei der Modernisierung ihrer derzeitigen Kampflugzeug-Flotte bereit. Angesichts zunehmenden Konflikte verfügt nur die F-35 als modernstes Kampfflugzeug weltweit über die notwendigen Fähigkeiten, um aktuellen und zukünftigen Bedrohungen zu begegnen. Diese Entscheidung für die F-35 steht für einen weiteren Ausbau unserer Partnerschaft mit Deutschland und für die Erweiterung der europäischen F-35-Präsenz. Heute gibt es in Europa etwa 120 F-35 in sechs Ländern. Voraussichtlich werden in den 2030er Jahren schon über 600 F-35 aus mehr als 10 europäischen Nationen integriert sein werden, einschließlich zweier kompletter U.S. F-35-Staffeln, die auf dem Stützpunkt Lakenheath der Royal Air Force stationiert sind. Die C-130J „Super Hercules“ ist mit über 500 ausgelieferten Luftahrzeugen an 22 Nutzerstaaten mit über 2 Millionen Flugstunden eines der bewährtesten und erfolgreichsten taktischen Transportflugzeuge. In 17 verfügbare Varianten deckt das Luftfahrzeug Missionsprofile wie Luft- und Bodenbetankung, Wetteraufklärung, elektronische Kriegsführung, medizinische Evakuierung (MedEvac) und viele weitere Aufgaben ab. Durchschnittliche Verfügbarkeitsraten von 80-90 Prozent liegen weit über denen der meisten Wettbewerber. Die Bundeswehr setzt ihre insgesamt sechs C-130J mit den Schwerpunkten nationales Risiko- und Krisenmanagement sowie Unterstützung Spezialkräfte ein. Die deutsche C-130J Flotte enthält drei Luftfahrzeuge in der Tanker-Konfiguration KC-130, welche die Fähigkeit der Luft- und Bodenbetankung sicherstellen. Die deutschen Luftfahrzeuge sind auf dem französischen Luftwaffenstützpunkt Évreux-Fauville in der Normandie stationiert und werden dort in einer binationalen deutsch-französischen Lufttransportstaffel betrieben. Der Staffel stehen insgesamt zehn Super Hercules von Lockheed Martin zur Verfügung. Das Aegis Kampfsystem ist das modernste Überwtasser-Kampfsystem mit erprobten und vielfach eingesetzten Fähigkeiten zur Verteidigung gegen hochentwickelte Bedrohungen aus der Luft und überwasser. Es wurde als komplettes System konzipiert: Raketenstartgerät, Computersoftware, Radar und Anzeigesysteme sind vollständig integriert. Aegis bietet auch Schutz vor ballistischen Flugkörpern und Hyperschallraketen und ist das einzige Marinesystem, das mit neuen und in der Entwicklung befindlichen Flugkörpern (wie z.B. Hyperschall Glide Phase Interceptor) integrierbar ist, um seine Fähigkeiten weiter zu verbessern, damit es mit sich ständig weiterentwickelnden Bedrohungen Schritt halten und neue Missionen erfüllen kann. Als moderne, flexible und skalierbare Lösung für alle Einsätze bietet die CMS 330-Technologie operative Effizienz durch eine nahtlose Einbindung von Systemen und Personal und ermöglicht so raschere und intelligentere Entscheidungen, die mit komplexen Bedrohungen in einer wandelbaren Einsatzumgebung fertig werden. Das CMS 330 integriert die Sensoren, Informationssysteme und Effektoren aller Schiffe und optimiert dadurch die Lageerfassung und Entscheidungsfindung, damit die richtigen offensiven/defensiven Effekte zielgerichtet und rechtzeitig bewirkt werden können. Das CMS 330 setzt den neuen Standard für Flotten-Konnektivität und Interoperabilität in gebietsübergreifenden gemeinsamen Einsätzen und schützt Ihre Besatzungen, damit sie sicher wieder nach Hause kommen.

The F-35 brings 5th Generation technologies, including low observable stealth with fighter aircraft performance, sensor fusion, net-enabled operations and electronic warfare capabilities. Combine the jet’s performance with an array of sensors that allow the pilot to maintain a complete picture of the threat environment. The F-35 provides a powerful solution for Greece’s national security requirements. The world’s greatest air forces use the F-35 to meet national security needs. Many of Greece’s traditional partners, such as the United Kingdom, Italy, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and the United States, are operating F-35s in the European theatre today. Belgium, Finland, Switzerland and Poland have also selected the F-35 and will soon operate in the country. The combat-proven F-16 plays a vital role in safeguarding Greece’s national sovereignty and defending Greek national airspace. Lockheed Martin and the Hellenic Aerospace Industry are partnering to upgrade a significant portion of the Hellenic Air Force F-16 fleet to the cutting-edge F-16V configuration. These upgrades will deliver a significant increase in capability for the HAF combat aircraft fleet, enabling the HAF to stay ahead of emerging threats and join the allied global mission. In 2020, Greece decided to add the MH-60R to their fleets. This agreement build on long-standing partnerships between Lockheed Martin and Hellenic Armed Forces. The MH-60R is known as “the world’s most advanced maritime helicopter.” And for good reason – there’s already more than 300 of them operating worldwide. By its commitment to acquiring the MH-60R, Greece will have unprecedented capability to perform anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare missions, along with the ability to perform secondary missions including vertical replenishment and search and rescue operations. Greece will be able to use the enhanced MH-60R capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense. The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) is a highly mobile automatic system that fires surface-to-surface rockets from the M270 family of launcher weapons platforms. The MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM) can be fired in less than one minute by the three-man crew. Lockheed Martin is working with customers to upgrade and extend the service life of M270 launchers. Enhancements include new 600 HP engines and fire control systems which will enable MLRS to fire next-generation munitions, including the Extended-Range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (ER GMLRS) and Precision Strike Missile (PrSM).

F-35 Lightning II F-16 Fighting Falcon MH-60R Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) M270 Η Lockheed Martin στην Ελλάδα Το F-35 είναι η πιο κατάλληλη λύση για την Ελληνική Πολεμική Αεροπορία. Το F-35 φέρει τεχνολογίες 5ης γενιάς, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των τεχνολογιών χαμηλής παρατηρησιμότητας (stealth), σύντηξης αισθητήρων, δυνατότητας δικτυοκεντρικών επιχειρήσεων και διεξαγωγής ηλεκτρονικού πολέμου. Συνδυάζοντας τις επιδόσεις του αεροσκάφους με μια σειρά αισθητήρων, ο χειριστής διατηρεί πλήρη εικόνα του περιβάλλοντος. Το F-35 αποτελεί την πλέον ισχυρή λύση για τις ανάγκες της εθνικής ασφάλειας της Ελλάδας. Οι μεγαλύτερες πολεμικές αεροπορίες του κόσμου έχουν επιλέξει το F-35 για να καλύψουν τις αμυντικές τους ανάγκες . Πολλοί από τους παραδοσιακούς συμμάχους της Ελλάδας, όπως το Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο, η Ιταλία, το Ισραήλ, η Ολλανδία, η Νορβηγία, η Δανία και οι Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες, διαθέτουν σήμερα το F-35. Το Βέλγιο, η Φινλανδία, η Ελβετία και η Πολωνία έχουν επίσης επιλέξει το F-35 και σύντομα θα αρχίσουν να επιχειρούν με το αεροσκάφος. Το δοκιμασμένο στη μάχη F-16 διαδραματίζει ζωτικό ρόλο στη διαφύλαξη της εθνικής κυριαρχίας της Ελλάδας και στην υπεράσπιση του ελληνικού εθνικού εναέριου χώρου. Η Lockheed Martin και η Ελληνική Αεροπορική Βιομηχανία (ΕΑΒ) συνεργάζονται για την αναβάθμιση ενός σημαντικού τμήματος του στόλου F-16 της Πολεμικής Αεροπορίας στην κορυφαία διαμόρφωση των F-16V. Αυτές οι αναβαθμίσεις θα προσφέρουν σημαντική αύξηση της ικανότητας του στόλου μαχητικών αεροσκαφών της ΠΑ, επιτρέποντάς της να παραμένει ένα βήμα μπροστά σε ενδεχόμενες αναδυόμενες απειλές και να συμμετέχει στη παγκόσμια αποστολή των συμμάχων. σε συμμαχικές αποστολές. Το 2020, η Ελλάδα αποφάσισε να προσθέσει το MH-60R στον στόλο των ήδη υπαρχόντων 11 S-70B/B6. Αυτή η συμφωνία βασίζεται στη μακρόχρονη συνεργασία μεταξύ της Lockheed Martin και των Ελληνικών Ενόπλων Δυνάμεων. Το MH-60R είναι γνωστό ως «το πιο προηγμένο ναυτικό ελικόπτερο στον κόσμο». Αυτός είναι ο λόγος που, σήμερα, περισσότερα από 300 MH-60R επιχειρούν παγκοσμίως. Με τη δέσμευσή της να αποκτήσει το MH-60R, η Ελλάδα θα έχει μια άνευ προηγουμένου ικανότητα να εκτελεί πολεμικές αποστολές τόσο κατά στόχων επιφανείας όσο και ανθυποβρυχιακές, με παράλληλη δυνατότητα εκτέλεσης δευτερευουσών αποστολών, όπως ο κατακόρυφος ανεφοδιασμός και επιχειρήσεις έρευνας και διάσωσης. Η Ελλάδα θα είναι σε θέση να χρησιμοποιήσει την ενισχυμένη ικανότητα των MH-60R ως αποτρεπτικό παράγοντα για τις περιφερειακές απειλές και να ενισχύσει την άμυνά της. Το Πυραυλικό Σύστημα Πολλαπλής Εκτόξευσης (MLRS) είναι ένα εξαιρετικά ευέλικτο αυτόματο σύστημα εκτόξευσης πυραύλων εδάφους-εδάφους της οικογένειας πυρομαχικών M270 (MFOM).

For the World.  Lockheed Martin’s proposed F-21 partnership with India will deliver advanced, scalable capabilities to the Indian Air Force, provide unmatched industrial opportunities, and accelerate India-US cooperation on advanced technologies. F-21: The Right Fighter for the Indian Air Force C-130J Super Hercules MH-60 Romeo S-92® Helicopter Partnerships in India Lockheed Martin News for India Lockheed Martin India Meet the F-21. Specifically configured for the Indian Air Force, the F-21 provides unmatched ‘Make in India’ opportunities and strengthens India’s path to an advanced airpower future. The F-21 addresses the Indian Air Force’s unique requirements and integrates India into the world’s largest fighter aircraft ecosystem with the world’s pre-eminent defence company. Lockheed Martin and Tata would produce the F-21 in India, for India. The C-130J Super Hercules program represents a strong legacy of partnership between the U.S. and India. The Indian Air Force operates a fleet of 12 C-130Js, making India one of 22 nations in the world that choose the Super Hercules for its tactical airlift missions. The IAF’s C-130J fleet represents the first major military contract between the U.S. and India in more than 40 years. IAF crews continually exemplify the C-130J’s unmatched capabilities and versatility to support a variety of missions, from cargo delivery to providing vital humanitarian aid to regional military activities. India’s connection to the C-130J goes beyond its fleet of Super Hercules with the Tata Lockheed Martin Aerostructures Limited (TLMAL) joint venture, which is the single, global source of C-130J empennage assemblies included on all new Super Hercules aircraft. Located in Hyderabad, TLMAL exemplifies the Government of India’s “Make in India” objectives and has delivered almost 200 empennages since it began operations in 2010. TLMAL also sponsors an on-the-job women’s apprenticeship program, which provides critical manufacturing and business skills to help employees grow within India’s aerospace industry in support the broader “Skill India” initiative. The Super Hercules is also part of India’s C-130J Roll-On/Roll-Off University Design Challenge. Through this initiative, Lockheed Martin provides research grants for teams from Indian universities to work with local industry partners and mentors from India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation to develop design specifications for proposed modules that could be used on a Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules cargo aircraft. MH-60R is the latest thread in the stories of Lockheed Martin and U.S.-India partnerships. It is the largest program for Lockheed Martin in India in support of United States Government foreign military sales. The MH-60R provides a vital capability for the Indian Navy in the Indo-Pacific region. The US Navy and its’ MH-60R international partners are committed to operating the MH-60R for the next 30 years. An MH-60R acquisition allows the Indian Navy to benefit from an active production line getting them this capability quickly, and the ongoing support we are providing for over 300 MH-60Rs flown by the U.S. Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, Royal Danish Navy, and the Royal Saudi Naval Forces. MH-60R acquisition ensures partner Navies are part of the technology insertion roadmap, including obsolescence mitigation, ensuring the Romeo stays relevant and ahead of the evolving threat environment. Sikorsky – a Lockheed Martin company – relies on a joint venture company called Tata Sikorsky Aerospace Ltd. (TSAL), in Hyderabad, India, as the manufacturing base for its global supply of cabin aerostructures for the S-92 helicopter. Since production began in 2010, TSAL has delivered 157 cabins to Sikorsky’s S-92 assembly plant in the United States. Today, production of more than 5,000 precision components that compose each S-92 cabin is 100 percent indigenous to India — supplied by TSAL. With more than 2.2 million fleet flight hours and nearly 95% availability, the S-92® helicopter is the industry’s standard for safety and reliability. The S-92 helicopter performs a variety of missions, including offshore oil transportation, search and rescue, Head of State and airline missions. With a presence in India for over 30 years, Lockheed Martin opened our India subsidiary in New Delhi in 2008 and has supported and aligned itself with various initiatives of the Government of India, like Make in India, Startup India and Skill India. Lockheed Martin continues to explore opportunities for closer collaboration and partnerships, including supporting the Digital India initiative. As a part of its larger commitment to enhance the growth and development of India’s innovation, Lockheed Martin has sponsored and supported the India Innovation Growth Programme (IIGP) since 2007 in partnership with the Indian Department of Science and Technology, Indo-U.S. Science and Technology Forum, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Stanford Graduate School of Business, and the IC2 Institute at the University of Texas. Resonating with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Start-up India” call, the IIGP has pioneered an initiative that has supported more than 400 innovators and start-ups with in-depth technology commercialization training and handholding support to commercialize and scale their ventures in India and across the world, particularly in the United States.

Our C-130 and F-16 aircraft have been faithfully serving the Israel Air Force since the 1970s and 1980s, and when a Letter of Agreement was signed in October 2010, Israel became the first country to select the F-35 through the United States government's Foreign Military Sales process. We also believe in strengthening the industries and individuals that will fuel future growth for Israel. By delivering on industrial commitments with Israeli companies, we bolster advanced technology and local research and development. Our stewardship of STEM, in collaboration with key government Ministries, inspires the scientists and technology professionals of tomorrow.  Featured Programs The world’s only international 5th Generation multirole fighter. Conceived in the mid 1990s, the tri-variant F-35 represents the pinnacle of more than 50 years of fighter development technology. Designed to dominate the skies, the F-35 combines the 5th Generation characteristics of radar evading stealth, supersonic speed and extreme agility with the most powerful and comprehensive integrated sensor package of any fighter aircraft in history. On June 22, 2016, the Israeli Air Force received the first F-35A Adir for Israel at a ceremony at the Fort Worth, Texas, F-35 factory. The Israeli Air Force declared its F-35 fleet operationally capable in December 2017, marking the completion of an intensive integration and training effort conducted at Nevatim AFB, Israel. The Israeli Air Force gave the F-35 the Hebrew name Adir, meaning \"Mighty One\" in Hebrew – and ordered a total of 75 F-35A’s. In the final days of 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Defense formally signed an agreement with the U.S. government for the purchase of 12 CH-53K helicopters, built by Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company. The FMS agreement includes an option for the IAF to procure an additional six helicopters. Israel’s Brigadier General Michel Ben Baruch signed the document at the IMOD’s mission in New York City. With this deal, the Israeli Air Force becomes the first international customer to procure the brand-new heavy-lifters. The CH-53K King Stallions will support the IAF’s needs for at least 50 years, replacing the current fleet of CH-53D “Yasur” helicopters, which operate in the Israeli Air Force since 1969. The procurement of the CH-53Ks is part of the Israeli Defense Force’s large-scale plan to strengthen its forces in the face of existing and future threats. The all-new CH-53K delivers modern state-of-the-art capabilities that result in improved survivability, safety, and reduced aircrew workload over its predecessor, making it the perfect fit for the demanding IAF mission. Also, with a reduction in support equipment footprint compared to the legacy fleet, the CH-53K will mean reduced operating costs. The aircraft will be manufactured at Sikorsky headquarters in Stratford, Connecticut, leveraging the company’s digital build and advanced technology production processes. The world's second largest fleet of Fighting Falcons. The F-16 has been the most important fighter jet in the Israel Air Force for nearly 35 years. Since the arrival of the very first F-16A/B Falcon fighters in 1980, the F-16 has proven its worth in numerous prestigious operations and has respectfully earned a prominent position in the Air Force. Over the years, the Air Force has ordered additional groups of more advanced F-16 fighters, such as the F-16C/D Barak and lastly the F-16I Sufa. Lockheed Martin has supplied the Israel Air Force with 102 two-seater F-16I Sufa fighters, of a model specially adapted for Israel. The first Sufa fighters arrived in February 2004 and the entire quantity that was ordered was delivered within five years. Due to these acquisitions, Israel became the owner of the largest fleet of F-16 fighters outside the United States. The most proven. And still proving it. The first Hercules C-130H arrived in Israel in October 1971. The C-130E/H - or the Rhinoceros - as it is affectionately known in this country, earned its glory in Operation Entebbe, to rescue hostages from Uganda. It took part in countless humanitarian missions and special operations and in the collection of the Jewish Diaspora, as the Jews of Ethiopia were airlifted to Israel as part of Operation Solomon. The new C-130J \"Shimshon\" is continuing the impressive legacy set by the Hercules squadrons over more than 40 years of service. There is no aircraft in aviation history — either developed or under development — that can match the flexibility, versatility and relevance of the C-130 Hercules. With more than one million hours of flying combat, humanitarian, special operations, aerial refueling, firefighting, and search and rescue missions around the world, the C-130J stands ready for its next mission and for whatever the future holds for Israel.

Playing a part in that alliance and working in partnership with local businesses, Lockheed Martin delivers cutting-edge technologies and innovations to support the future prosperity of Japan and its communities.  F-35  SPY-7  Black Hawk  Sea Hawk®  Armed Black Hawk  Aegis Lockheed Martin’s STEM Education Program in Japan Lockheed Martin in Japan Working with our Japanese partners, we are committed to partnering with industry to shape best-value solutions that deliver low-risk, proven capability with high levels of local content, technology transfer and workshare. Examples include: The F-35 Lightning II is designed and built to counter the most advanced threats – making it a perfect fit for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF).  The world’s most powerful and versatile radar keeping you safe at home and abroad.  Today’s operational aircraft for Japan include the UH-60J and UH-60JA fleets, which are based on Sikorsky’s S-70 Black Hawk. The UH-60J is used primarily for search and rescue, while the UH-60JA variant is employed for utility missions. Japan also operates a variant of the Sea Hawk, the SH-60J/K helicopter. While it’s primarily used operated for anti-submarine patrol, the whole H-60 family in Japan is renowned for saving lives during natural disasters over the years. 三菱重工 manufactures and maintains H-60 helicopters under a comprehensive Licensing Agreement with Sikorsky. 三菱重工 configures and maintains each variant for the Self-Defense Forces.  The aircraft that’s made for any mission just got even more versatile. For security and battlefield support, the Black Hawk helicopter can now be outfitted with an advanced weapon system. In short, it simplifies the complex task of placing rounds onto a target by calculating the complex ballistics required for effective airborne gunnery. The installable armed kit is designed to boost any Black Hawk’s combat capabilities, at half the cost per flight hour compared to a dedicated heavy attack helicopter.  Aegis provides four of Japan’s Kongo-class destroyers and two Atago-class destroyers with advanced sea, air and undersea threat detection capabilities. Lockheed Martin sees education as a crucial investment for both business and society, and will continue working closely with our partners to enhance the collaboration between industry and educators to advance STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education in Japan. Lockheed Martin provides sponsorship to the biannual National Model Rocketry Competitions as well as the Rocket Koshien, which feeds into the International Rocketry Challenge. It also provides three educational awards for the best female team at each of these events. The Girls’ Rocketry Challenge, which launched in October 2016, aims to encourage female students to explore their curiosity in the STEM field, utilising model rocketry for a hands-on approach to scientific experimentation and practical application of theoretical knowledge outside of the classroom. The Girls’ Rocketry Challenge has expanded its reach from the Kanto region of Japan in the first cycle, to now include schools nationwide. The program is run in partnership with the Japan Association of Rocketry, a non-profit organization that sets the industry standard for model rocketry in Japan with the support of Leave a Nest, a science education company that also runs workshops on model rocketry. In 2018, the program also welcomed Chiba Institute of Technology as a supporter, enabling GRC participants to receive further guidance in their learning journey in rocket science.

The CH-53K®: A Multi-Role Special Operations Force Multiplier F-35 Lightning II  T-50 Golden Eagle  C-130 Hercules  MH-60R  S-92 South Korea Coast Guard F-16 Fighting Falcon  KDX-III Aegis Destroyer  PAC-3  Industrial Partnership Lockheed Martin Korea Our expertise has helped the Republic of Korea with integration for major defense and civil programs to address national priorities, including: stronger Korean national defenses, modernized air traffic control and new space and telecommunications opportunities. We work closely with the Republic of Korea military and Korean industry to meet the country’s mission-critical requirements through the wide array of programs you see below. The most powerful, most advanced production helicopter in operation today, the CH-53K delivers the versatility, speed, and range Special Operations missions demand. Special Operations forces can maintain superiority in the next-generation battlespace, thanks to the CH-53K’s industry-leading power, mission equipment and full authority fly-by-wire flight controls. Built to thrive on the modern battlefield, the CH-53K aircraft is designed to be intelligent, reliable, low maintenance and survivable in the most austere and remote forward operating bases. Here’s how the CH-53K outperforms the competition: Unmatched Versatility: Enables full range of military operations – special operations, troop insertion & extraction, air assault, and air logistics. Range: Travels long distances and in environmental extremes with triple the cargo of the legacy aircraft it replaces and double its nearest competitor. All-Environment Performance: Retains its performance in high, hot, low visibility, and sea-based environments. Designed to Stay Ahead of Evolving Threats: Digital design and fly by wire flight controls provide a path to autonomy, optionally piloted vehicles and crewed / uncrewed teaming.         The MH-60R is the most capable and proven multi-mission maritime helicopter operating in the world today. Its fully integrated mission sensors prioritize information into actionable knowledge. This enables aircrews and commanders to make the best tactical decisions in today’s fast-moving, complex warfare environment: keeping the Republic of Korea safe now and far into the future.       Aegis will join the next three KDX-III Sejong the Great Class destroyers, a multi-purpose destroyer with air and land defense and anti-submarine capabilities. Aegis is aboard three KDX-III destroyers: RoK Sejong the Great, RoK Yulgok Yi I and RoK Seoae Ryu Sungryong, which are the largest surface warfare ships to carry Aegis. The Republic of Korea joined the international Aegis fleet in 2008, when the navy commissioned the first ship of the class, Sejong the Great.   The Republic of Korea Air Force is upgrading their Patriot missile system to the more advanced PAC-3 missile interceptor, allowing ROKAF to defend against ballistic missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction using Hit-to-Kill technology. The Republic of Korea signed a Letter of Acceptance on March 13, 2015. Lockheed Martin highly values its long-standing relationship with the Republic of Korea and Korean industry partners.

F-35 - Ensuring Sovereignty S-70™ Black Hawk® Helicopter  HIMARS  PAC-3 MSE  F-16 Pilot Training Lockheed Martin in Romania The Government of Romania confirmed its intent to procure 32 Lockheed Martin 5th Generation F-35 Lightning II aircraft by signing a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) through a U.S. government Foreign Military Sale. This decision marks a significant milestone in Romania's defence strategy and its commitment to maintaining a robust and advanced military force. The F-35 plays a crucial role in 21st Century Security® by deterring threats and disrupting adversaries' plans. By its very presence, the F-35 enhances the safety of nations operating it and protects freedom around the world. The F-35 offers the most cost-effective solution for Romania, combining unprecedented operational capability with an affordable and efficient global sustainment network. This partnership promises technological advancements, reinforcing Romania's position in the global defence landscape. It also represents a significant leap in defence technology and international collaboration. The Romanian Air Force's F-35s will integrate seamlessly with existing the F-16 fleet, enhancing the unique, powerful capabilities of each aircraft and establishing a fortified defence profile. The F-35 is the world’s most advanced aircraft today and is rapidly becoming the 5th-generation fighter of choice for Europe, NATO, and their allies globally. It is the only fighter aircraft able to survive and dominate in a high threat environment against current and future threats and will provide the Romanian Air Force with the ability to control and defend Romania’s sovereign territory well into the 2070s. Romania’s Ministry of Internal Affairs signed a framework agreement in 2021 with PZL Mielec, a Lockheed Martin company, that will lead to the procurement of up to 12 new-generation S-70M™ Black Hawk® utility helicopters, manufactured in Poland. In 2023, Romania received seven S-70M helicopters as part of a framework agreement for up to twelve Polish-built S-70M Black Hawks. In June 2024, Romania’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, Department of Emergency Situations, awarded PZL Mielec a contract to procure an additional new-generation Black Hawk utility helicopter for emergency and firefighting services. This additional aircraft will join Romania’s fleet of European manufactured Sikorsky S-70M Black Hawk utility helicopters, currently providing maritime and land search and rescue, firefighting, transport and medical emergency support. Romania made this purchase funded by European Union RescEU funds, part of the European Civil protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations created to fund, among other items, a fleet of firefighting planes and helicopters. Romania joins a global family of Black Hawk operators and becomes the 11th country and 18th customer for Black Hawk helicopters built by PZL Mielec, Poland’s largest exporter of aerospace equipment. The cabin of both the land and maritime variant Black Hawks will accommodate a medical suite designed and provided by DELTAMED, a Cluj-Napoca-based integrator of emergency vehicles outfitted for patient care and rescue.  The multi-role S-70 Black Hawk features digital avionics, powerful GE engines, high strength airframe structures and composite wide chord rotor blades that yield increased situational awareness, survivability and performance. Designed to demanding military standards, the S-70 Black Hawk helicopter is a dual-use platform that is ideally-suited to perform the long-range and high-altitude missions required by Romania’s Ministry of Internal Affairs. This includes disaster relief, search and rescue, medical transport, external cargo lift, firefighting, and maritime emergency missions. In 2024, Lockheed Martin and Aerostar S.A. inaugurated the first certified S-70 Black Hawk helicopter maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) service centre in Europe. The Black Hawk centre established in Bacau will support Black Hawk operational availability and sustainment. Romania’s HIMARS provide strong deterrent capability to support national defence. HIMARS is a combat-proven system that offers deterrence against aggression and is significantly increasing the capability of NATO and its allies across the globe. A lightweight mobile launcher, HIMARS is transportable via C-130 and larger aircraft for rapid deployment and fires ATACMS missiles, the next-generation Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and GMLRS rockets, to include the extended-range variant– ER GMLRS. Romania was the first European user of HIMARS in 2021. The PAC-3 family of missiles are the only combat proven Hit-to-Kill interceptors that defend against incoming threats, including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. Ten nations – the United States, Qatar, Japan, Romania, Poland, the United Arab Emirates, Sweden, Korea, Bahrain and Germany – have signed agreements to procure PAC-3 MSE interceptors. As part of its role in JADO, PAC-3 has demonstrated integration with the THAAD Weapon System, the U.S. Army’s Integrated Air and Missile Defence Battle Command System (IBCS) and F-35, the most advanced node in the 21st century warfare network-centric architecture.   The first European F-16 Training Centre was inaugurated in 2023 at the Fetești Air Base in southern Romania. Lockheed Martin and subcontractors, Daedalus Aviation Group, Draken International, GFD, a subsidiary of Airbus Defence and Space, and ILIAS Solutions, will work as one team to provide F-16 training at the centre, which is the result of unique collaboration between the Romanian Ministry of National Defence, the Romanian Air Force and the Royal Netherlands Air Force, in partnership with Lockheed Martin. This team maintains the F-16 fighter jets provided by the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) to support F-16 pilot training delivered by experienced F-16 instructor pilots with recent front-line experience flying F-16s in the U.S. Air Force and air forces throughout Europe. To further compliment this training, expertise is provided in the European Military Airworthiness Requirements regulatory framework covering aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul requirements.   Lockheed Martin is committed to supporting the Ministry of Economy’s work to strengthen the capabilities of Romania’s aerospace and defence industry and to investing in long-term partnerships that support the creation of high-skilled jobs and technology transfer. We are supporting the development of Romania’s next generation of scientists, engineers and technologists who will be critical for the nation’s future, as evidenced by our collaboration with the technical university of Cluj-Napoca on AI related projects for both commercial and military applications.

Această aeronavă suplimentară se va alătura flotei românești de elicoptere utilitare Sikorsky S-70M Black Hawk de fabricație europeană, care asigură în prezent servicii de căutare și salvare maritimă și terestră, stingerea incendiilor, transport și sprijin medical de urgență. România a făcut această achiziție finanțată din fonduri RescEU ale Uniunii Europene, ca parte a operațiunilor europene de protecție civilă și ajutor umanitar create pentru a finanța, printre altele, o flotă de avioane și elicoptere pentru stingerea a incendiilor. România se alătură astfel unei familii globale de operatori Black Hawk și devine a 11-a țară și al 18-lea client pentru elicopterele Black Hawk construite de PZL Mielec, cel mai mare exportator polonez de echipamente de apărare și aerospațiale. Cabina elicopterelor Black Hawk S-70 pentru misiuni terestre și maritime va include o unitate medicală echipată de Deltamed, cu sediul la Cluj-Napoca, un integrator experimentat de vehicule de urgență concepute pentru îngrijirea pacienților și operațiuni de salvare.  Elicopterul multirol S-70 Black Hawk dispune de avionică digitală, motoare GE puternice, structuri de înaltă rezistență ale celulei și pale de rotor cu coardă largă din materiale compozite, aceste caracteristici oferind o mai bună înțelegere a situației pe teren precum și o creștere a capacității de supraviețuire și a performanței. Elicopterul S-70 Black Hawk, proiectat conform unor standarde militare exigente, este o platformă cu dublă utilizare, ideală pentru misiuni dificile, cu rază lungă de acțiune și operare la mare altitudine, precum intervenții în caz de dezastre, căutare și salvare, transport medical, transport cargo la exterior, stingerea incendiilor și patrulare maritimă. Designul militar al acestor elicoptere robuste le permite să zboare în condiții meteorologice și de mediu dificile. Cu peste 5.000 de aeronave Hawk produse, peste 5 milioane de ore de zbor în operațiuni de luptă și cu îmbunătățiri continue, aceste elicoptere versatile și multi-misiune sunt operate de mai mult de 35 de țări. În 2024, Lockheed Martin şi Aerostar SA au inaugurat primul centru de servicii de întreţinere, reparaţii şi revizie (MRO) certificat pentru elicopterul S-70 Black Hawk din Europa. Centrul Black Hawk înființat la Bacău va sprijini disponibilitatea operațională și întreținerea Black Hawk. Sistemul HIMARS al României oferă o puternică capacitate de descurajare pentru a sprijini apărarea națională. HIMARS este un sistem dovedit în luptă care oferă o capabilitate de descurajare împotriva eventualelor agresiuni și crește semnificativ capacitatea NATO și a aliaților săi din întreaga lume. Un lansator mobil ușor, HIMARS este transportabil cu ajutorul unui C-130 și cu aeronave mai mari pentru o desfășurare rapidă și lansează rachete ATACMS, rachete de nouă generație Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) precum și rachete GMLRS, inclusiv varianta cu rază extinsă - ER GMLRS. România a fost primul utilizator european al HIMARS în 2021. Familia de rachete PAC-3 sunt singurele interceptoare Hit-to-Kill dovedite în luptă, care protejează împotriva amenințărilor primite, inclusiv rachete balistice tactice, rachete de croazieră și aeronave. Zece națiuni - Statele Unite, Qatar, Japonia, România, Polonia, Emiratele Arabe Unite, Suedia, Coreea, Bahrain și Germania - au semnat acorduri pentru achiziționarea interceptoarelor PAC-3 MSE. Ca parte a rolului său în cadrul JADO, PAC-3 a demonstrat integrarea cu sistemul THAAD, sistemul integrat de comandă a luptei pentru apărarea antiaeriană și antirachetă (IBCS) al armatei SUA și cu F-35, cel mai avansat nod din arhitectura centrată pe rețea a războiului secolului XXI.   Primul centru european de pregătire F-16 a fost inaugurat în 2023 la Baza Aeriană Borcea - Fetești din sudul României. Lockheed Martin și subcontractanții săi Daedalus Aviation Group, Draken International, GFD – o filială a companiei Airbus Defence and Space, și ILIAS Solutions vor forma o echipă pentru a asigura instruirea pentru operarea avioanelor F-16 în cadrul noului centru. Acesta este rezultatul unei colaborări speciale între Ministerul Apărării Naționale din România, Forțele Aeriene Române și Forțele Aeriene Regale ale Țărilor de Jos, în parteneriat cu Lockheed Martin. Această echipă va fi responsabilă de întreținerea avioanelor de luptă F-16 furnizate de Forțele Aeriene Regale ale Țărilor de Jos (RNLAF) în vederea susținerii instruirii furnizate de piloți instructori experimentați de avioane F-16, cu experiențe recente în prima linie de luptă, care au pilotat F-16 în cadrul Forțelor Aeriene ale SUA și al altor forțe aeriene din întreaga Europă. În completarea pregătirii, se oferă expertiză în ceea ce privește cadrul de reglementare al cerințelor europene de navigabilitate militară, care acoperă cerințele de întreținere, reparare și revizie a aeronavelor.

Today, Lockheed Martin’s presence in the Kingdom has moved beyond defense systems by providing diverse products and services, technical support and educational expertise for the Kingdom’s defense industry, as the country works towards ensuring that Saudi Vision 2030 becomes a reality. The Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Sikorsky Black Hawk Helicopter C-130J Super Hercules Satellite Solutions Saudi Assembly, Integration & Test (AI&T) Program Advanced Electronics Company (AEC) Sustainment Facility Prince Mohammad Bin Salman College (MBSC) Of Business & Entrepreneurship  Saudi Arabia In 2017, Saudi Arabia expressed its intent to procure more than US $28 billion in integrated air and missile defense, combat ships, tactical aircraft and rotary wing technologies and programs with Lockheed Martin. Today, Lockheed Martin Saudi Arabia is working to support these projects, ensuring they align with Vision 2030 and support the security of the Kingdom for decades to come. In May 2017, the United States Navy and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) for four MMSCs. MMSC is a highly maneuverable multi-mission surface combatant capable of littoral and open ocean operation. It was designed from the keel up to confront modern maritime and economic security threats and will provide the Kingdom with enhanced maritime Lockheed Martin is supporting the U.S. government and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as they move forward with the procurement of the THAAD system. One of the world’s most advanced missile defense systems, THAAD can protect against incoming short through medium range missile threats, and will help strengthen global and regional security while supporting job creation and economic prosperity in the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. THAAD is rapidly deployable, mobile and interoperable with all other Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) elements, including Patriot/PAC-3, Aegis, forward-based sensors and the Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications system. Lockheed Martin’s PAC-3 Hit-to-Kill interceptors provide high precision and unmatched air missile defense for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The PAC-3 family of missiles defend against incoming threats - including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft - using direct body-to-body contact that delivers exponentially more kinetic energy on the target than can be achieved with legacy blast-fragmentation kill mechanisms. The Kingdom is working with the U.S. Army to provide 57 UH-60M Black Hawks through the Foreign Military Sales channel. These aircraft are currently in production. The multi-mission UH-60M is the latest in the Black Hawk helicopter product family. It will bring new life to the existing fleet – improving effectiveness, reducing vulnerability and lowering operating and support costs. The Royal Saudi Land Forces have been flying the Black Hawk since it was first delivered in 1990. Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company, is also advancing the agreement for the development of a local rotorcraft manufacturing capability as outlined in Vision 2030 enabling the production of up to 150 Black Hawk helicopters in the Kingdom. Over 50 years ago, Lockheed Martin entered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with the delivery of the first C-130 airlifter in 1965. Today, Saudi Arabia has the distinction of operating one of the world's largest fleets of Hercules airlifters. In 2016, the Kingdom received its first two KC-130J Super Hercules aerial refuelers, bringing proven and unmatched capabilities to one of the most recognized C-130 operators in the world. In 2015, Arabsat and KACST awarded Lockheed Martin a contract for two LM 2100-based satellites: Arabsat-6A and Hellas Sat 4/SaudiGeoSat-1 will provide advanced telecommunications capabilities to customers in the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Hellas Sat-4/SaudiGeoSat-1 was successfully launched out of French Guiana in February 2019. Both satellites are the first to be built on Lockheed Martin’s modernized LM 2100 bus, which makes each of them more capable and flexible. The program also involved a crucial capacity building component for Saudi engineers, who have been given practical hands-on training at Lockheed Martin’s satellite manufacturing facilities in Sunnyvale, California. The Assembly, Integration & Test (AI&T) On-the-Job Training program is an academic and hands-on training partnership with King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) designed to build qualified talent to support future satellite AI&T of telecommunications satellites. The initiative combines a variety of knowledge-transfer methodologies to deliver a world-class and accelerated AI&T Certification experience via Lockheed Martin materials and subject matter experts. As part of the program, Lockheed Martin hosted 11 Saudi nationals who were trained and prepared to support future satellite assembly, integration and test of telecommunications satellites. This space training program is a great example of how Lockheed Martin is supporting initiatives to ensure that Vision 2030 becomes a reality through partnerships that build skills and create opportunity in the Kingdom. Since the 1990s, Lockheed Martin has worked with Advanced Electronics Company on sustainment efforts for a variety of products, including LANTIRN targeting and navigation pods and the Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor. Together, we provide the Kingdom and the RSAF with advanced capabilities and technology to successfully maintain their defense fleets. Lockheed Martin is proud to partner with Saudi Arabia’s Advanced Electronics Company to repair sensor systems for Saudi Arabia’s F-15 aircraft since 2016. In 2016, we partnered with King Abdullah Economic City, the MiSK Foundation and Babson College to launch a new entrepreneurship college, Prince Mohammad bin Salman College of Business and Entrepreneurship (MBSC). MBSC aims to support and nurture Saudi talent in the fields of science, research and applied studies through world-class hands-on learning. The college welcomed its first class of students in September 2017 for the two programs: a full-time MBA program and an executive/part-time MBA program.

Martin established the Glenn L. Martin Company in Los Angeles, California. He started the company after building his first plane in a rented church, where he took a leap of faith on his risky but innovative new aircraft design at the urging of none other than Orville Wright. Four months later and four hundred miles away, on December 19, 1912, Allan and Malcolm Lockheed founded the Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company, later renamed the Lockheed Aircraft Company. Talented mechanics, they set up shop out of a garage, constructing seaplanes that would shatter speed and distance records for overwater flights. A church and a garage. These were humble beginnings. But these were also men of unrelenting vision and unwavering purpose. The gift that Martin and the Lockheed brothers shared was a unique ability to look past the obstacles of today to the promise of a brighter tomorrow. And they knew – as we’ve known for 100 years – that innovation, performance and purpose were the keys to accelerating that tomorrow. Take a journey looking back at the innovations and achievements that helped our customers rise to some of the world’s most vital challenges.

It’s about getting results in the right way. Our leaders are expected to continually promote ethical behavior and make decisions that protect the health and safety of employees as well as the natural environment through Full Spectrum Leadership. Ultimately, every one of us is a leader, because we all control the attitudes and behaviors of at least one person - ourself - and we set an example for our colleagues. Lockheed Martin is striving to establish the tools and reinforce the values that provide everyone with rewarding work in a safe and supportive environment. But it’s up to each one of us as individuals to embrace the culture we’re creating. Corporate culture change takes place in two ways: It grows from the bottom up, as shifting social and economic realities weave their way into the fabric of an organization. And it flows from the top down, as leaders recognize the inevitable changes taking place in the world and shape them to serve the best interests of the organization and everybody who is part of it. Full Spectrum Leadership is Lockheed Martin’s model for promoting and accelerating the latter type of change - the type that allows the company to create its own destiny and ensure that it will continue to thrive in the face of new competitive challenges.

We operate in the highly regulated global security industry, and our operations are affected by the actions of elected and appointed officials at many levels of government. Our public policy activities include advocacy efforts at the federal and state levels, thought leadership regarding global security trends, and other important issues impacting the Corporation and our customers, educational outreach and promotion, and other related activities. Lockheed Martin complies with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with the Company’s political and public policy activities. Any political or other public policy activity in which Lockheed Martin engages, including political expenditures, comply with all internal policies and procedures, are made solely based upon the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders, and are not based on personal agendas of individual directors, officers, or employees. Responsibility for managing and coordinating the Company’s political and public policy activities lies with its Lockheed Martin Government Affairs function. Corporate Political Contributions and Expenditures Independent Expenditures. Lockheed Martin has not spent any direct corporate funds on independent expenditure communications to the general public that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified federal candidate, and has no present plans to spend direct corporate funds on such communications. International Contributions. Lockheed Martin does not contribute money, assets, property or other things of value to any foreign candidates or political committees. State Contributions. In certain states where permitted by law, Lockheed Martin makes corporate political contributions in accordance with established criteria, including to candidates and political committees whose positions on business issues are important to the Corporation; candidates who represent geographic areas where Corporate facilities are located; or candidates who have leadership positions or committee assignments that are important to the Corporation’s interests. All corporate contributions are fully disclosed with the appropriate state or local campaign finance authority, as well as published on this website. 527 Political Organizations. Since 2014, Lockheed Martin has not provided funding to 527 political organizations that are not registered as a federal or state political committee, with the exception of the National Governors Association (NGA) beginning in 2020 and the Democratic Governors Association (DGA) beginning in 2024. Lockheed Martin maintains membership in the NGA and DGA as a means to support our operations in numerous states. In over half the states in which we operate we employ from a thousand to over twenty thousand people. We do not consult with the NGA and the DGA regarding expenditures of their funds. The primary contact with the NGA and the DGA is Robert Head, Vice President, Political Affairs, State Government and Global Programs Support. Political Action Committee. In accordance with federal law, Lockheed Martin does not make corporate contributions to federal candidates or federal political committees. The corporation supports the Lockheed Martin Employees’ Political Action Committee (LMEPAC), which makes contributions to federal and state candidates, political committees, party committees, and other section 527 political organizations. LMEPAC is funded exclusively through voluntary contributions from eligible employees and directors; employees participating in LMEPAC are not reimbursed, directly or indirectly, for political contributions or expenses. LMEPAC supports federal and state political candidates who support national defense and other business issues of interest to the corporation. Disbursements by LMEPAC are made solely based upon the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders, and are not based on personal agendas of individual directors, officers, or employees. All LMEPAC contributions are fully disclosed in reports filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and can be accessed by going to the FEC website, as well as published on this website. Trade Associations. Lockheed Martin contributes to public policy debates by participating in trade and industry associations, as well as engaging directly in advocacy and grassroots communications efforts. In the U.S. we advocate strong national defense, sustained space exploration, development of alternative energy technologies, corporate tax issues (including tax incentives for corporate research and development), export policy and international trade. We join trade associations that represent a broad spectrum of views on industry and policy issues important to our business interests. Mission consistency is important to us, and we review our participation – with this in mind – on a regular basis. While we do not always agree with the views of these groups, nor do we always agree with our industry peers, we are fully committed to collaborative problem-solving and to working within these industry structures. We believe that is the best way to address a problem, have the greatest impact, and get to the best outcome. Our participation in trade associations is subject to management oversight by the Company’s Lockheed Martin Government Affairs function. Lockheed Martin Government Affairs serves as the principal representative of the Company in trade and industry associations, as well as approves Company membership. Lockheed Martin pays regular dues to several trade associations. Some trade associations utilize a portion of membership dues for non-deductible state and federal lobbying and political expenditures. Per the requirements of Section 162(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, the trade associations to which we contribute must provide us with the percentage of our annual dues that are attributable to lobbying expenses. A listing of the national-level trade associations to which Lockheed Martin paid dues of $25,000 or more in a single year and the portion of these dues not deductible under Section 162(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code are published on this website. Lobbying Expenditures. Lockheed Martin lawfully engages in the legislative process to communicate its views on legislative and regulatory matters affecting the Company’s business. Lockheed Martin’s Government Affairs function only engages in public policy and political activities directly related to the company’s business interests, such as national defense, space exploration, alternative energy technologies, corporate tax, export policy and international trade. Lockheed Martin’s Ethics and Enterprise Assurance function assesses how our trade associations’ public policy positions align with our sustainability policy including climate-related issues. More information about our sustainability program can be found here.  Federal lobbying activities are regulated by the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA). In accordance with the LDA, the Company files quarterly disclosure reports with the Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate regarding payments for all federal lobbying activities. These reports disclose all direct and indirect expenses related to lobbying, expenditures for grassroots efforts, and payments to trade associations that are used for lobbying. The reports are available here. (Search Field: \"Registrant Name\" Criteria: \"Lockheed\"). In states where the Corporation is engaged in advocacy efforts and is registered to lobby, the Corporation files reports as required with the appropriate state agency. Lockheed Martin files all lobbying disclosure reports at the federal and state level in a complete and timely manner in accordance with applicable requirements. All decisions regarding corporate political and public policy activities are managed by the Senior Vice President, Lockheed Martin Government Affairs, following coordination with individual Lockheed Martin elements in accordance with established policies and procedures. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors, which is composed entirely of independent directors, oversees our government affairs activities and political spending, receives reports from management on these matters, supervises the policies and reviews the purposes and benefits of these activities. The Corporation’s political activities are audited on a regular basis in accordance with the Corporation’s established audit schedule. Outside legal counsel provides regular guidance regarding compliance with all applicable laws and regulation of political activities. Decisions regarding the Lockheed Martin Employees Political Action Committee are made by the PAC’s board of directors.

These global challenges are an integral part of our mission, driving innovations that protect employees, save lives, increase efficiencies, reduce costs and minimize environmental impacts. We are committed to facing these complex challenges head on, promoting innovation and responsible growth while contributing to a more sustainable future for our employees, communities and shareholders. By integrating environment, safety and health (ESH) considerations into our operations and business practices, we create value by decreasing business risks and identifying opportunities while increasing the productivity, efficiency and quality of our employees’ work environment. In keeping with key objectives to protect, enhance, optimize and simplify, our strategic focus areas guide our actions to ensure effective execution of our ESH mission. Lockheed Martin is committed to operating in a manner that prevents environmental, safety and health (ESH) accidents and incidents, actively manages risk, conserves natural resources, protects the environment, and ensures the safety of employees, contractors and the public. Our ESH policy applies to all Lockheed Martin operations and outlines responsibilities for its successful implementation across the corporation. Our ESH policy provides key processes and integration methods for managing the ESH aspects of our business, and through it we state: Consistent with the commitments and requirements identified in our ESH policy, Lockheed Martin has procedures that establish an ESH management system to continually improve ESH performance, fulfill legal and other requirements, and achieve our ESH objectives. Lockheed Martin’s ESH management system is a systematic approach to the identification and mitigation of the risks or hazards of, as well as the realization of the opportunities provided by, the ESH aspects of our operations, products and services. This ESH management system, that covers all of Lockheed Martin’s operations, is our foundation – driving regulatory compliance with an emphasis on continuous improvement across our business. Lockheed Martin’s ESH management system, through our enterprise or central function, is certified to the internationally recognized ISO 14001 and 45001 standards for environmental and occupational safety and health management, respectively. In addition to Lockheed Martin’s enterprise ESH management system, several of our individual operating sites have achieved certification to the ISO 14001 and/or ISO 45001 standards. A complete list of the individual sites that are managed with our enterprise-level certification can be found here. The scope of each site’s certification and/or certificate can be made available upon request. Lockheed Martin also focuses on the integration of ESH into sustainable business operations, including but not limited to product design, services, procurement, supplier selection, manufacturing, and property upgrade/renovation/rearrangement. Our programs provide access to ESH resources, including technology, best practices, lessons learned, and detailed legal requirements of countries in which Lockheed Martin operates, including resources relevant to emerging legislative and regulatory requirements and industry trends. Our Chemical Sustainability Program is one example of how we are addressing global emerging regulatory issues. We continuously seek opportunities to reduce and eliminate hazardous chemicals in our products and operations. We collaborate with our industry partners, such as the International Aerospace Environmental Group, to develop industry-wide solutions and common standards for working with the global supply chain on chemical regulations and other environmental issues. The Lockheed Martin Safety and Health program goes beyond compliance to optimize Lockheed Martin operations through targeted safety, health and wellness opportunities designed to ensure safe work conditions, a healthy work environment, promote workforce resiliency and enhance business value. We make a difference, together with our stakeholders to integrate, enable and instill core safety and health competencies for workplace design, work practices and for workers to ensure successful implementation of the corporation’s mission. Since its initiation in 2004, the Lockheed Martin Target Zero program focused employees and leaders in the direction of injury prevention to protect our most important asset: our people. Together we find the way to ensure a safe and healthy workforce and workplace through ergonomic and operational design, protective work practices, worker resilience and targeted safety and health risk reduction techniques. Our approach to drive improvement encompasses education, leader accountability and employee engagement through a variety of safety and health programs and initiatives. The safety and health of every employee is paramount to our success as a business and is a strategic imperative for our organization. The Zero in on Safety technique is an easy way to remember that everyone is responsible for the safety and health of our work environment. When you encounter a situation that could cause an injury, just use the Zero in on Safety IDEA technique to remember what you need to do. This technique can be used in any situation – at work or at home – to protect against life limiting injuries and ensure you live healthy productive lives and enjoy what matters most to you. It’s always a good IDEA to Zero in on Safety! Safety Moments deliver employee testimonials and conversational stories through entertaining educational videos driving injury prevention awareness so that employees learn techniques to Zero in on Safety With heritage operations dating back to the early 20th century, Lockheed Martin has built its success on long-standing innovation and business excellence as well as strategic acquisitions.

May, Product Test Technician Specialist During her time at Lockheed Martin, May has coordinated assembling thousands of American Red Cross comfort kits, provided donated supplied to a local orphanage, collected donated medical equipment for a hospital in the Philippines, led a group of more than 50 volunteers to pack more than 100,000 meals for Hurricane Dorian victims...and the list goes on. May knows all too well what it means to have nothing. In 1979, she and her family made the dangerous journey to the U.S. on a Vietnamese refuge boat and were sponsored and helped by a church in Minnesota. It wasn’t until 2014 that May’s love for volunteering began. “When I start something, I give it a 200% effort. I’ll handle the organizing and the scheduling – and then from there it’s all about the volunteers coming out to make it happen. I just enjoy helping people and there are so many people who need help and it makes me feel great.\"  Anthony, Senior STF System Engineer Anthony's passion for volunteering and giving back is a regular part of his weekly routine. As a father of three, he frequently volunteers his time and expertise to mentor and teach local children rugby skills and contributes to fundraising initiatives for charities benefiting children’s hospitals and schools. Due to his personal connections to several individuals who have battled cancer, Anthony is also dedicated to supporting charities focused on cancer awareness, research and advocacy. He frequently volunteers his AV technical expertise for events and takes part in fundraising cycle rides across Europe to raise awareness and funds for the cause. “We all have the opportunity and responsibility to leave the world a better place. I know my life was made better by various scout leaders and other volunteers when I was growing up. Now, as a father of three kids, I am even more motivated to make the world better for them and to show them that they have the power to change what they wish to see in the world.”  Byron is a key player in his community. During his time at Lockheed Martin, he has coordinated and facilitated meaningful STEM outreach activities with students, organized supply packing events benefitting his local Food Bank, and volunteered time with his city to decorate the community park for the holiday season. What drives Byron to give back to his community? “I read a quote once that said, ‘kindness is a language that the deaf can hear and the blind can see.’ In my experience, volunteerism brings out the best in people from all walks of life, working together towards a common goal.” Growing up as a \"military brat,\" Crystal was always surrounded by a strong sense of community and support. Her father, a career Command Sgt. Major, instilled in her the importance of giving back and helping those who protect our way of life.  “I'm passionate about two main areas: STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) and military veteran support. Having worked for Lockheed Martin, I understand the importance of fostering the next generation of engineers and innovators.” Crystal, along with her family, actively dedicate their time to various organizations and causes, such as Engineering Week (E-Week), Solar Car Challenge, Tarrant Area Food Bank, Flags for Fallen Vets, Junior AG Robotics Challenge, and numerous other community initiatives.  Scott’s passion and commitment to students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) goes back several years. During his time with Lockheed Martin, he has coached multiple FIRST teams in his local community. He helped start the Dorkside (FIRST) Robotics team at the Young Women’s Leadership Academy in Fort Worth, Texas, and has been a proud mentor for the team over the years. “The best part about mentoring and supporting organizations like FIRST is getting to see the students grow their skills and self-confidence.” He has witnessed firsthand the direct impact his efforts have made. Students he previously mentored have participated in Lockheed Martin’s internship program and four have accepted full time job offers after completing their internships. Today they credit their exposure to robotics in middle school with setting them on their STEM journey."}

{"url":"https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/ethics.html","title":"Ethics | Lockheed Martin","content":"Ethical Standards and Integrity Investigations and Reporting of Potential Misconduct When employees face ethical dilemmas in their workplace, they are encouraged to use the Voicing Our Values techniques - Ask Questions, Obtain Data, Talk to Others, and Reframe the Issue. If unable to resolve the conflict using these techniques, or in the event of a compliance breach, employees should report any possible violations to their manager, Human Resources Business Partner, Legal, Security, Internal Audit, EESH or Ethics. Contact Corporate Ethics Lockheed Martin’s success depends on our commitment to integrity. Our core values – Do What’s Right, Respect Others and Perform with Excellence – are fundamental to who we are and what we do. At Lockheed Martin, we believe that doing what’s right is more than just obeying laws and regulations. It’s holding ourselves to a higher standard, even when the law may not require us to do so. We refuse to allow our integrity to be compromised by our desire to succeed, regardless of the circumstances of our business. Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Setting the Standard, outlines our high expectations for employees and others who act on behalf of our company and provides the foundation for our award-winning Ethics program. We require all employees, consultants, contract laborers and Board members to agree to abide by our Code of Conduct.  We help them understand and mitigate the legal and regulatory risks they may face by providing interactive Business Conduct Compliance Training courses. And we use our annual leader-led Ethics Awareness Training to prepare employees to recognize and respond to situations that require ethical decision making. We also communicate with employees year-round on key ethics and compliance topics, including but certainly not limited to Corruption and Human Trafficking. Our episodic Integrity Minute series is one of the primary communications tools we use to keep Ethics top of mind. The Senior Vice President (SVP), Ethics and Enterprise Assurance (EEA) reports directly to the President and CEO and reports regularly to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. The SVP, EEA provides the Board members with frequent updates on the Ethics and Enterprise Assurance activities of the corporation, including providing summary reports on Ethics and Business Conduct activities, and responds to their feedback. These summaries include reports on key metrics such as ethics office contacts, including investigations. Ethics and Business Conduct activity summaries and metrics are also presented to the corporation’s Executive Leadership team four times per year. Ethics is of such importance at Lockheed Martin that it is our first corporate policy: CPS-001. In addition, all Lockheed Martin employees have included in their annual performance assessments an evaluation of their adherence to the Lockheed Martin ethical principles. Performance assessments are a significant factor in determining multiple aspects of the employee experience, including employee compensation.  Lockheed Martin promptly and thoroughly investigates all alleged violations of laws, regulations, policies, procedures, or the Lockheed Martin Code of Ethics & Business Conduct, “Setting the Standard,” that occur in the workplace or in off-premises situations with a relationship to the workplace or that affect the workplace. Potential violations may be identified through normal compliance channels or raised by whistleblowers and other concerned employees. This includes any potential violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other international anti-corruption laws (together, “Anti-Corruption Laws”), whether the allegations involve individuals employed directly by Lockheed Martin or those with whom we partner, such as agents and suppliers. For more details on internal investigations at Lockheed Martin, see CRX-021, Internal Investigations. This procedure covers incident investigations reported through both internal and external reporting channels. The procedure is reviewed whenever associated regulations change. In addition, it is Lockheed Martin’s practice to annually identify any policies that have not been updated in 3 years, and, if needed, assess the need for them to be reviewed. Lockheed Martin employees are required to report suspected violations of law or policy, including potential violations of the Anti-Corruption Laws, so that the Corporation can investigate and, if appropriate, disclose the misconduct to the cognizant government entity or entities. Transparency is paramount to Lockheed Martin’s ethics and compliance program. CPS-718, Disclosures to the U.S. Government ensures that Lockheed Martin promptly and fully discloses to the responsible authorities all violations of federal law and instances of significant employee misconduct affecting or influencing its operations. There are several avenues for employees to report suspected misconduct, including through Management, the Ethics Office, the Legal Department, and Security. For a complete list of these avenues, all of which include the option for confidential and anonymous reporting, see the pamphlet How the Ethics Process Works. In addition, posters referencing external reporting channels, such as the Department of Defense (DOD) waste, fraud, and abuse hotline, are posted in Lockheed Martin facilities. The Corporation has the necessary controls in place to ensure the confidentiality of whistleblowers and other confidential reporting parties. We commit to supporting and protecting employees who refuse to act unethically. The corporation assesses employee beliefs in this commitment through regular confidential all-employee surveys that measure Ethics-related concepts such as ethical accountability, ethical leadership, and non-retaliation. In our most recent 2019 all-employee survey, we asked a total of sixteen (16) Ethics questions, such as: “I am comfortable raising concerns about compliance or ethics with my manager,” “I can report unethical practices without fear of retaliation,” “I do not feel pressure to compromise ethical or compliance standards to get my work done,” and “Unethical behavior is not tolerated at Lockheed Martin.” Lockheed Martin does not tolerate retaliation of any kind. 800-LM-ETHIC (800)-563-8442 Monday-Friday 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. ET Corporate.Ethics@lmco.com 6801 Rockledge Drive Bethesda, MD 20817"}

The ability to effectively question and respectfully challenge is at the core of our capability to maintain high standards of integrity. Lockheed Martin’s annual ethics awareness training, Voicing our Values, is inspired by the work of Mary C. Gentile and her book, Giving Voice to Values: How to Speak Your Mind When You Know What’s Right. Our training provides a forum for employees to see the roadblocks they can face in mustering the courage to address issues, and to explore how they might handle similar circumstances. Lockheed Martin always achieves 100% participation in live leader-led ethics awareness training. Annual training begins with our CEO training the executive leadership team. Those leaders then train their respective teams and this cascade continues until all employees have participated in a training session facilitated by their manager. The heart of the training are video-based scenarios addressing the kinds of issues employees face every day. The professional actors who star in our video scenarios have become quite familiar to Lockheed Martin employees. Here’s the introduction to a recent training program.  During the training, participants gather in small groups to view several video scenarios, which reflect real situations that have occurred, or might occur at Lockheed Martin. Participants discuss the cases and talk about how to apply the Voicing Our Values techniques - Ask Questions, Obtain Data, Talk to Others, Reframe the Issue, and how to Report Violations. Lockheed Martin has never shied away from talking about tough issues. In recent training, participants viewed and discussed topics such as sexual harassment and opioid use in the workplace and how to speak up in those difficult situations. After viewing the first part of each case video, the employee participants discuss how effective the characters were at voicing their values. The case then concludes with an executive wrap-up at the end.   "}

Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) successfully demonstrated this logistics/resupply capability to the U.S. Army in October 2022 using an optionally piloted Black Hawk helicopter. Read the story MATRIX technology forms the core of DARPA’s ALIAS (Aircrew Labor In-cockpit Automation System) project, an ongoing partnership between Sikorsky and DARPA. The autonomy project is designed to exponentially improve flight safety, reliability and efficiency of both rotary and fixed wing aircraft. Sitting on the runway in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, one of Sikorsky’s pilots in an S-70™ BLACK HAWK® helicopter flips the optionally piloted cockpit switch from two to zero, exits the aircraft and walks across the runway. Moments later, the Model A BLACK HAWK aircraft, identifiable by DARPA’s logo and tail number N60-OPV, completes a pre-flight check list, starts its engines, spins up its rotors and takes off with no crew onboard. All of it happens fully autonomously. Read the story   Sikorsky Autonomy Research Aircraft (SARA) is a modified S-76B helicopter that Sikorsky has converted into a flying lab. Using SARA, Sikorsky continues to test and improve MATRIX™ technology for optionally piloted flight, as well as technologies for commercial applications, such as firefighting, cargo and urban air mobility. SARA can perform full-authority flight control inputs for autonomous flight — including takeoff, route planning, obstacle avoidance, site selection and landing.

We are the research labs for Lockheed Martin Space. The ATC creates foundational technologies that inspire, protect and connect our world. Our history goes back to 1956, founded in Palo Alto, California, helping seed what would become Silicon Valley. Today, we still carry on the legacy that started our labs, like the very beginnings of solar science and rocket technology (even underwater). We continue to evolve and lead the way in new realms, like lasers, nanomaterials and informatics. At the ATC, we’re driving change in our endless pursuit of what’s next. ATC’s inventions and innovations create first-of-a-kind of capability. Its technology paved the way for the first imaging satellites, showing our majestic planet from orbit. We built the first solar instruments that illuminated the source of solar storms, honed systems that can shoot down UAVs with directed energy, see the unseen with lidar and ladar and developed precision controls that allow our telescopes to zoom in to 1% of the sun’s surface. We also developed the foundational technology that launched the first submarine-launched ballistic missile. The ATC team continues to make a difference with projects in three technology categories: Applying proven methods in new ways to advance missions in production. Developing and inventing evolutionary technology for emerging opportunities. Researching solutions and shaping opportunities for far-future challenges. 500 Technologists, scientists and engineers advancing the state of the art Through our own skills and those of our partners—including universities and research labs around the world—we’re able to put vision in motion. While we are a part of Lockheed Martin Space , our technologies are far reaching across domains. Napkin sketches of lasers that can shoot down UAVs—we made it real. Changing molecules so metals behave differently? We invented that. How about training telescopes to act together so we get a precise look at what’s in orbit thousands of miles away? We made that possible. Creating space observatories that can zoom in on 1 percent of the sun’s surface? We did it. And sometimes what we develop benefits other industries, like graphene advancements could help filter drinkable water or treat diseases inside the body. ATC’s story is written in the success of missions here on Earth and far, far into space.

Electronic Warfare Is Divided Into Three Major Areas: Electronic Attack Electronic Protection Electronic Support Why It Matters Investing in the Fight We're engineering a better tomorrow. Electronic Warfare In tomorrow’s battlespace, victory may be secured before the first shot is fired, through silent control of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). Lockheed Martin is building the capabilities to ensure U.S. and allied forces never lose the advantage in this critical, invisible domain. Imagine having a gun with unlimited rounds. That’s what electronic warfare gives you. It diverts threats at a low-cost through unlimited non-kinetic effects, preserving strategic kinetic fires for high-value targets. Through EW, we can achieve operational and strategic objectives by targeting the enemy’s ability to sense, communicate, decide, and act. EW uses electromagnetic energy to disrupt, disable, or destroy an adversary’s ability to use the EMS — which spans radio waves, microwaves, infrared, and visible light. EW is a critical component of modern warfare, enabling military forces to gain a strategic advantage over their adversaries. By combining intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), cyber operations, EW, and information operations (IO), we deliver integrated capabilities for Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO). Adversaries rely on the EMS to plan and execute operations.

Experience Innovation Operations Discover How We Explore Deep Space  The Moon      Mars          The Planets        Asteroids and Comets       The Sun and Stars        Technologies and Operations  Deep Space Exploration The spacecraft and systems that we design, build and operate have been a part of exploring every planet in our solar system. They have landed on Mars, executed tiny orbits around asteroids, flown past Pluto and explored the Kuiper Belt—the farthest distance any space vehicle has ever gone. Our integrated systems provide the power and protection needed to safely navigate through the cruise stage, keep even the smallest, most precise orbits on course, and withstand the challenges of entry, descent and landing (EDL). The instruments we developed for these missions collect vital scientific samples and data and send them back to Earth. And on the ground, our mission support teams keep spacecraft flying and information flowing to scientists and engineers for analysis. The experience and knowledge gathered from these robotic missions not only provides us with valuable data about our solar system, but it also informs a key goal of deep space exploration: sending humans to the Moon and Mars in the not-so-distant future and providing the infrastructure for a new space economy.   The Moon Mars The Planets Asteroids and Comets The Sun and Stars Technologies and Operations Our deep space exploration capabilities begin with our closest celestial neighbor — the Moon. We have played a part in missions like Lunar Prospector that discovered the first evidence of water ice at the lunar poles, and we engineered and led operations for GRAIL that mapped the Moon’s gravitational field. We also built Lunar Trailblazer, which was designed measure the form, abundance and distribution of water the lunar surface. Our industry-leading expertise in lunar exploration has prepared us for the eventual return of humans to the Moon with NASA's Artemis program.      We have been a part of every NASA mission to Mars including the first lander — Viking 1 in 1975 — and have built half of the 22 spacecraft that have gone to the Red Planet. Our successful aeroshell and heatshield technology has supported the entry, descent and landing of those assets. In addition to spacecraft development, we conduct critical flight operations, including for the three current NASA Mars orbiters. These spacecraft have provided valuable communications data for a combined 11 landed assets, including the active Curiosity and Perseverance rovers. Our latest pursuit explores Mars Sample Return as a firm-fixed price solution, reducing cost and complexity to bring these valuable samples to Earth. This will set the stage for future human exploration of the Red Planet.   Our legacy of deep space exploration is unmatched as we have played a crucial role in planetary exploration with spacecraft and components visiting every planet in the solar system—including Pluto. We’ve even been a part of every NASA mission to Mars, building landers, orbiters, heat shield systems and more. The spacecraft and components that we’ve designed and built for NASA have helped advance our understanding of the formation of the solar system and the evolution of the planets. Future NASA missions to Venus and Saturn’s moon, Titan, and the return of surface samples from Mars, are in development and will expand our understanding of the Earth’s celestial siblings.     The history of where we come from is written in the fossils of the early solar system, and the technologies and capabilities developed by our engineers are providing scientists with data like we've never seen before. The spacecraft we've designed and built have done it all. From visiting 10 asteroids during a 12-year mission with Lucy, returning samples of an asteroid like we did with OSIRIS-REx, capturing solar wind particles with Genesis and returning samples of a comet with Stardust, Lockheed Martin is at the forefront of discovering how these smaller cosmic objects may have been instrumental in the development of life on Earth.     You could say we're experts at reaching for the stars. The spacecraft we've built to study the stars have provided the scientific community with a wealth of data. It starts with the center of our solar system as MUSE and IRIS are studying the Sun to better understand the behaviors of its atmosphere and by tracing the flow of energy and plasma into the corona and chromosphere. But we aren't stopping there. We've proven to be time travelers as we've designed and built the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope and NIRCam, the primary imager on the James Webb Space Telescope. These technologies allow scientists to peer back in time to just after the birth of the universe, giving humanity a glimpse of where we come from.   It takes innovative technologies and capabilities for all of these deep space exploration missions to succeed. We've implemented novel technologies like Natural Feature Tracking (NFT) on OSIRIS-REx to autonomously map and navigate around an asteroid, and developed aeroshell capabilities that protect NASA's planetary landers. And we offer our customers important products, operations and services, including our Smallsat Solar Array Lab, which develops solar power systems for various missions and destinations, our Mission Support Area that operates and commands customer spacecraft and even offer testing as a service to ensure customers' spacecraft and components are ready for their journeys.

Since the days of the Apollo program, Artemis is taking what we’ve learned from those missions to go beyond — landing on the Moon but also building a presence there that eventually takes us farther into the solar system than we have ever gone. The building blocks of space infrastructure required to carry humanity on this journey are in development today. At Lockheed Martin, we have a vision for how this future will play out - how each additional piece of infrastructure will build on the next as we explore space, build a lunar economy and settle permanently and sustainably among the stars. Our approach for a responsible and effective path forward is water-based, nuclear-enabled and commercially-invested.  Mars has intrigued humankind for hundreds if not thousands of years. It’s potentially the one place in our solar system beyond Earth that could have harbored life. We’ve been exploring Mars for more than five decades with robots and in the near future, we’ll explore Mars in person. Mars is in our past, it’s in our future and at Lockheed Martin, it’s in our DNA. Our conceptual vision for the first interplanetary voyage to Mars is called Mars Base Camp. While in orbit around the Red Planet, Mars Base Camp will provide astronauts a home away from Earth, a platform for conducting critical science and a base to send humans to the surface and back during its three-year mission. Built up at the lunar Gateway, Mars Base Camp leverages the Orion spacecraft, along with nuclear thermal propulsion and inflatable habitation, to enable human space exploration of Mars. A safe and achievable concept, our Mars orbiting outpost is designed to be led by NASA and its international and commercial partners."}

Achieving Spectrum Superiority Investing in the Fight Our Work Partnership & Preparation We're engineering a better tomorrow. Electronic, Cyber & Information Warfare Electronic, Cyber & Information Warfare (ECIW) is a Lockheed Martin Product Portfolio focused on ensuring our customers can dominate the full Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS), bringing capabilities to bear in the realms of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), cyber techniques and effects, electronic warfare (EW), and information operations (IO), while integrating platforms to enable Joint All Domain Operations (JADO). Ongoing digital transformation is having a dramatic effect throughout the EMS. Adversaries use the EMS to plan and execute their operations while friendly forces look to maintain dominance across the joint, all-domain environment. As a result, the Department of Defense and its allies are increasing their ability to see and control the virtual battlefield thanks to an integration of capabilities from ISR, EW, Cyber, and IO, but a lot of work remains – that’s where we can help. By converging these technologies, the U.S. military and allies gain an advantage, where digital attacks can cripple enemies in advance of, and in coordination with, strikes across air, land, sea, space and cyberspace. Lockheed Martin’s ECIW team focuses on developing technologies that ensure warfighters stay ahead of EMS and information-based threats. In the electromagnetic spectrum, Armed Forces face increasingly complex challenges. They must coordinate over dispersed combat zones. Military and civilians’ wireless devices such as cell phones crowd the EMS. Adversaries use the spectrum to plan and execute their operations. And they’ve also applied military and commercial technologies to create new operational advantages. This environment makes distinguishing friend from foe a daunting task. According to the U.S. 2020 Department of Defense (DoD) Electromagnetic Spectrum Superiority Strategy, the DoD is “challenged to assure and maintain access, use, fires, and maneuver within the electromagnetic spectrum at home and abroad.” Lockheed Martin’s ECIW team understands these threats and are developing advanced technologies to confront them. As part of our 21st Century Security® vision, we’re working to ensure the U.S. military and its allies maintain superiority in the dense electromagnetic spectrum – a critical element of being successful in all-domain operations. This includes developing adaptable and open architectures for affordable and agile responses to today’s and future threats. We’re also using artificial intelligence technologies and novel technology to resolve spectral chaos for warfighters so they can achieve their mission objectives in contested environments – a key component for optimal joint, all-domain operations. To accelerate the development and deployment of 21st Century Security® capabilities required for EMS superiority, we are investing in and partnering with commercial companies to strengthen the defense industrial base and bring cutting-edge defense tech to the modern multi-domain battlespace. Our 50+ years of experience with multi-domain systems helps us to identify and invest in new technologies that help warfighters effectively manage and operate in the electromagnetic spectrum. Adversaries’ communications and non-communications radio frequency threats are rapidly evolving. This drives the need for affordable solutions that can quickly adapt. Our expert team is making great strides in assisting battlefield commanders in their understanding of the electromagnetic environment, performing command and control, and delivering prioritized, effective and tailored responses.

Led by Jason, a chief engineer at Sikorsky Innovations, this team is developing a new type of aircraft that blends the vertical lift capabilities of a helicopter with the speed and efficiency of a fixed-wing plane. The Rotor Blown Wing (RBW) is a game-changing aircraft powered by a rotor that generates lift and propulsion, and a fixed wing that provides additional lift and stability. This hybrid design allows the aircraft to take off and land vertically like a helicopter while achieving high-speed, long-range flight like a traditional airplane. The potential applications of the RBW are vast, with missions ranging from search and rescue to long-endurance surveillance and reconnaissance. We sat down with Jason to hear about his experience working on a first-of-its-kind aviation technology and what it has taught him about innovation, teamwork, and risk-taking.  Working on a project like RBW requires a willingness to accept risk and push the boundaries of what's possible.  This agile approach enables the team to test, iterate and refine designs in months rather than years, accelerating progress beyond traditional development cycles. Jason recalls a pivotal moment that set the tone for the group: \"The first time we had a failure during testing for this vehicle, we were all concerned, but the approach from leadership was that we learned a lot from that test, and now we can redesign those components that failed, and use that as the baseline moving forward.\"  For Jason, working on RBW is a career-defining opportunity that aligns with his lifelong passion for aircraft design. \"I've always wanted to work on new aircraft development, and it's been a really rewarding area for me.\" Beyond the excitement of working on trailblazing technology, Jason said he values the opportunities for career growth, skill development, and collaboration that Lockheed Martin offers. Most importantly, Jason enjoys seeing how the projects he works on directly benefit military personnel. \"I've always been proud of the work that Sikorsky does. You'll regularly hear of the various life-saving missions that Sikorsky products do, and every time we walk through the door, there's a screen that is updated with how many lives our products have saved each year. It's incredible to see how useful and applicable these vehicles are, and what they actually mean for people.” RBW is designed to meet the urgent mission needs of Lockheed Martin's customers that current aircraft cannot fulfill. To address these gaps in capability, the aircraft is being developed with autonomous operation features, including real-time navigation and decision making enabled by AI algorithms and advanced sensors. Autonomy in aviation offers significant advantages including improved safety, enhanced operational efficiency and increased mission flexibility. In the future, autonomous aircraft will support a wide range of missions, from surveillance and reconnaissance to cargo transport and medical evacuation. And as the defense industry continues to evolve, the need for systems that can operate seamlessly together to achieve a common goal is becoming increasingly important.  RBW integrates Sikorsky’s MATRIX™ technology, a sophisticated flight control system that combines software and hardware components to enable operation in complex environments. \"Flying with MATRIX gives us a pathway to easy customer operation off of a tablet or a single computer interface. There’s the potential for pilot-drone teaming, where you're able to send mission commands to the vehicle and it can go out and execute autonomously.\" By leveraging autonomy, RBW has the potential to revolutionize mission execution, ensuring greater effectiveness while reducing the risk for human operators.  Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky Innovations operates with the nimbleness of a startup within the context of a larger, more resourced company. \"We're operating in a fast schedule, we're taking risks, and we're trying to advance these technologies as fast as we can. But unlike a startup, we have the resources that we can pull from the greater Sikorsky and Lockheed business to enable us to move at speeds that you otherwise wouldn't be able to.\" This combination of innovation and resources enables Jason's team to develop remarkable technology at an unprecedented pace, and they're just getting started.

An Internship That Launched a Career  From Intern to Space Engineer: Building a Career with Impact The Rocket Launch That Launched a Career For Nicole, an engineer working on our National Security Space team, the path to a career in aerospace was shaped by hands-on experiences, inspiring mentors, and a passion for engineering that took flight, literally, when she witnessed her first rocket launch... In high school, Nicole was first introduced to the field when she worked on a robotics project, turning a simple block of wood into a functioning robot. The project challenged her to think creatively, and after competing (and winning) at a robotics competition in Baltimore, her passion for electrical engineering was born. That spark was reignited years later when an internship with Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) took her to the heart of the Space Coast. Nicole first connected with Lockheed Martin at a college conference, where she learned about the company’s internship program and the opportunities available. During her internship, she worked on an Independent Research and Development (IRAD) project, coding software for F-35 pilot training simulators. Although she had limited coding experience at the time, the project was a valuable learning opportunity. Seeing firsthand how the software enhanced pilot safety and effectiveness was a pivotal moment in her career. Coming from a military family, the experience was especially meaningful, knowing her contributions were directly supporting key mission. Beyond technical skills, Nicole took full advantage of networking opportunities. From ice cream socials to speed mentoring and leadership meetings, she sought out conversations that could shape her career. A meeting with one mentor, Dorcia, had a profound impact. As her internship ended, Nicole knew she wanted to stay with Lockheed Martin—but also pivot toward space. Encouraged by a mentor, she voiced her interest, leading to a full-time career in national security space, where she now contributes to critical defense missions and has built a strong sense of belonging. Today, she plays a hands-on role in developing space technologies that will travel beyond Earth’s atmosphere. She has also refined a key skill—translating complex technical work into clear, impactful communication essential to Lockheed Martin’s success. Reflecting on her journey, Nicole has valuable advice for future interns hoping to turn their experience into a career: From a robotics project in high school to playing a hands-on role in national security space programs, Nicole has truly aligned her skills with her passion. Her journey is a testament to how curiosity, hard work, and the right opportunities can turn dreams into reality.

Ethically Engineered. | Lockheed Martin","content":"Smarter Tech. Safer Futures. Ethically Engineered.  A Real-World Test of Ethical Engineering  Real-World Inspiration  Insights from the Judges: Ethics in Action Judging Excellence Texas A&M Takes the Win  Beyond the Competition: Lifelong Impact Smarter Tech. Safer Futures. Ethically Engineered. An inside look at how Lockheed Martin’s annual case competition challenges future engineers to navigate real-world innovation. In February, Lockheed Martin hosted its 8th annual Ethics in Engineering Case Competition, where 66 university teams gathered to tackle a timely, real-world challenge: using artificial intelligence and human input to improve wildfire management. Acting as consulting firms, the teams analyzed a custom-built case study and presented their recommendations to a panel of Lockheed Martin leaders and ethics professionals. Over two days, students were pushed to think beyond technical innovation, grappling with complex issues of public safety, data integrity, and accountability. The immersive format encouraged teams to weigh ethical trade-offs, defend their decisions in head-to-head rounds, and demonstrate how thoughtful engineering can shape lives and communities for the better. From real-time astronaut calls to real-world case studies, the competition was as inspiring as it was rigorous.  Perhaps the most unforgettable moment came from a surprise guest: Astronaut Sunita Williams, who joined live from the International Space Station. Students were visibly moved—wide-eyed and smiling—as they gained a deeper appreciation for the real-world impact of Lockheed Martin’s innovations. Mike Baylor, Lockheed Martin’s Chief Digital and AI Officer, also addressed the students, offering insight into how AI is strategically integrated across the company’s platforms. His message made it clear: the case wasn’t just a hypothetical—it mirrored the real engineering challenges our teams face today. Ben Miller, Director of the Colorado Center of Excellence for Advanced Technology Aerial Firefighting, helped ground the experience further by connecting the students’ work to the lives of firefighters battling devastating wildfires—showing how emerging technologies can help save lives and protect communities. In a tightly contested final round, Texas A&M University emerged as the champion over Pennsylvania State University. Their edge? The ability to articulate a clear, actionable strategy while incorporating real-time feedback from their competitors—mirroring the kinds of discussions engineers face on high-stakes projects.  The Ethics in Engineering Case Competition goes far beyond the classroom. It gives students a real-world preview of the professional challenges they’ll face—and how to tackle them with integrity, teamwork, and purpose.

{"url":"https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2026/things-you-may-not-know-about-orion.html","title":"14 Things You May Not Know About Orion | Lockheed Martin","content":"14 Things You May Not Know About Orion 14 Things You May Not Know About Orion Space fans may know that the Lockheed Martin–built Orion is the only human-rated spacecraft designed to carry astronauts into deep space and safely bring them home. On Artemis II, that capability becomes reality, as Orion carries a crew of four beyond the Moon for the first time in more than 50 years, paving the way for a sustained lunar presence and future missions to Mars. But how well do you really know the spacecraft? Here are 14 facts you may not know about Orion as it prepares to make history on Artemis II.  1. There’s an exercise machine inside Orion and it’s similar to a rowing machine The compact flywheel exercise machine is used for aerobic and strength workouts, and works similar to a rowing machine. All four astronauts have to exercise every day (except launch and landing days) to keep from losing bone mass. In order to exercise comfortably and efficiently, the machine will be placed on a 45 degree angle. 2. The energy dispersed by Orion’s heat shield during re-entry is about the same amount of energy of an EF3 tornado The energy exuded by Orion’s heat shield as it comes back into Earth’s atmosphere is approximately 640 gigajoules. This amount of energy dispersed is about two times the amount of energy created by a spacecraft returning from the International Space Station. 3. Orion’s heat shield will get up to 5,000°F during re-entry, yet the inside will stay comfortable in the 70s. The primary way Orion puts on its brakes before it splashes down is with its heatshield. As it screams through Earth’s atmosphere, friction and air resistance causes extreme temperatures on the heat shield reaching about 5,000°F during re-entry. These high temperatures are about 2.5x the temperature of lava and 66% hotter than spacecraft coming back from the International Space Station.  4. Returning from the Moon, Orion will go 24x faster than a speeding bullet  5. Orion will travel ~1000x farther into space than the International Space Station 6. There are 11 parachutes to slow down Orion in the Earth’s atmosphere and safely land on the ocean After Orion’s heat shield scrubs off most of the Orion’s speed, the parachute system, with its 11 parachutes, will slow the crew module during the last part of re-entry from 324 mph to 17 mph for a soft ocean splashdown. Orion uses is three main parachutes to land, though it can land safely using only two. All three main parachutes combined would cover a football field from 10 yard line to 10 yard line. 7. The crew systems in Orion are designed to accommodate 99% of the human population by size. Orion is designed to accommodate 99% of the human population, which is a larger range than every other NASA or Department of Defense project. The spacecraft can accommodate astronauts as small as a 4’10” and as tall as a 6’5”.  8. During the Artemis II mission, Orion will conduct a rendevous and proximity operations demonstration As Orion orbits around the Earth, prior to its translunar injection burn, it will practice a maneuver with the interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS) to test the docking system of Orion that will be used during the Artemis III mission when the spacecraft docks with the human landing system (HLS). 9. Orion can operate in deep space for a long time Orion has room for supplies and consumables to safely sustain a crew of four for up to 21 days. It can function unattended for six months in orbit when docked to the Gateway at the Moon. Orion has also been evaluated to support a 1,000 day mission to Mars when equipped with additional propulsion, habitats and supplies as part of a larger Mars transport system.  10. Orion’s crew module is rather roomy, sleeps four comfortably and has a private toilet 11. The computers on Orion are 20,000x faster than Apollo’s Orion’s main computers provides significantly faster computing speed over other human spaceflight vehicles. The computing speed of each computer is about 25 times faster than the International Space Station’s computers, 400 times faster than the space shuttle’s and have four independent computers running in parallel for redundancy. 12. Artemis II will resuse flight-proven hardware from Artemis I Artemis II won’t just build on the success of Artemis I, it will fly with parts that have already been to deep space and back. Ten components from the Artemis I Orion spacecraft are being reused on Artemis II, including nine avionics units that have already flown beyond the Moon. These include three inertial measurement units, one GPS receiver, four phased-array antennas, and one vision processing unit. Even one of the crew seats flying on Artemis II has already been to lunar distance and safely returned, giving the first crewed Orion mission an added layer of confidence from flight-proven hardware.  13. Orion is built using cutting-edge manufacturing technologies Advanced manufacturing is transforming how Orion is built. The spacecraft includes more than 150 3D-printed parts on Artemis II—up from just four on Orion’s first test flight in 2014. Engineers also use augmented reality during assembly, reducing training time by up to 85% and cutting some manufacturing tasks from eight hours down to just 45 minutes. 14. Orion can land upright, upside down, or sideways and it can flip itself upright Post-splashdown, Orion may be in any orientation. A system of five orange airbags inflates around the top of the spacecraft and helps right the capsule into an upright position so the crew can exit safely. "}

{"url":"https://www.boeing.com/strengthening-safety-and-quality","title":"Strengthening Safety & Quality","content":"Commercial Defense Space Services Safety Innovation Company Search Commercial Defense Space Services Safety Innovation Company Strengthening Safety & Quality What happened What we did Our Safety & Quality Plan Watch: Highlighting enhancements throughout 737 MAX Final Assembly Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act (ACSAA) Examples of Progress Go Deeper On Jan. 5, 2024, a mid-exit door (MED) plug detached from the left side of a 737-9 carrying 171 passengers and crew, leading to a rapid decompression. The pilots and cabin crew brought the airplane and everyone onboard safely back to the ground. Boeing fully cooperated with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in their investigations. Boeing took immediate action in January 2024 to ensure the safety of our fleet and production operations for all of our airplanes. Then, we gathered feedback from our employees, regulator, customers and independent experts to develop a comprehensive plan that strengthens our safety management, quality assurance and safety culture across our production systems. Boeing’s Safety & Quality Plan generally aligns to four focus areas: investing in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and elevating our safety and quality culture. The plan also sets forth measures to continuously monitor and manage the health of our production system. We are committed to this plan and to continuous improvement, which has helped make commercial aviation the safest mode of transportation. Updated: 11/25/2025  A significant component of our Safety & Quality Plan is the identification of six key performance indicators (KPIs) focused on safety and production health: Each KPI has defined criteria that help identify areas of potential risk to our operations and trigger corrective action through our Safety Management System (SMS). These metrics have helped Boeing conduct more targeted safety risk assessments in priority areas and maintain production health. Sept. 16, 2025 A new hands-on training program gives Quality inspectors realistic practice before they reach the production floor. By working with actual airplane sections and searching for planted, hidden defects, new-hires build skills and confidence, reducing errors and improving inspection accuracy. The program expands Boeing’s investment in workforce training and supports long-term product quality. Aug. 5, 2025 Boeing teams have introduced the Design Build Safety process to identify and address risks during production. More than 40 assessments have been completed, generating 1,300 actions to address potential issues. The process helps improve drawings, inspections and shop aids, leading to clearer instructions and safer, higher-quality builds. Aug. 4, 2025 Boeing teams have expanded a hazard assessment process that identifies when airplanes can safely move to the next manufacturing position in the factory. The approach has helped cut traveled work – unfinished jobs moving down the production line – by up to 50%. By addressing risks earlier, teams are improving production flow, stability and overall airplane quality. Jun. 30, 2025 At Boeing Salt Lake, the 737 electrical equipment shelves team redesigned its production area to improve workflow and organization. The new layout cut defects by 80%, shortened order lead time and reduced wasted space. Standardizing the process also boosted efficiency, teamwork and overall product quality. Jun. 3, 2025 Employee Involvement teams, made up of members from Manufacturing, Quality, Engineering and other areas, meet weekly to solve problems and drive improvements. In Portland, one team introduced a new air-powered tool for cleaning drilled metal holes. The change eliminated defects that led to rework and delays, boosting safety and productivity. May 20, 2025 A new employee-developed tool streamlines how Boeing tracks and validates airplane configuration changes. By compiling data from multiple systems in real time, the tool reduces errors, improves accuracy and shortens reporting from hours to minutes. The tool helps confirm that airplanes in development meet design requirements while supporting more efficient production. Apr. 15, 2025 New printers have streamlined the way employees label composite shims for the 777X wings. The improved process, inspired by employee feedback, replaces tedious manual labeling, saving hours of work. Each shim now features a QR code for improved traceability, allowing teams to track shims from order placement through installation. This innovation enhances accuracy and improves ergonomics for teammates. Mar. 20, 2025 The 787 program developed a new solution to protect wing tank air hose fittings and reduce fuel tank damage during production. Using 3D-printed components and protective tubing, the fittings stay securely in place and reduce the possibility of tool mark damage. The change enhances safety, reduces rework and supports more efficient production. Mar. 3, 2025 The 777X team activated a new production area with expanded space and upgraded equipment for composite wing component fabrication. The improvements enhance accuracy, reduce ergonomic challenges and streamline processes for teammates. With increased automation and capacity, the changes are an investment in long-term production stability. Feb. 24, 2025 More Boeing supply chain employees are working on the factory floor alongside their manufacturing and maintenance teammates. This approach helps teammates from different disciplines to more proactively address issues, streamline production flow and enhance collaboration. Jan. 31, 2025 Boeing introduced new guidelines for eliminating FOD – foreign object debris – in its commercial airplanes and production facilities. With simpler language and expectations, teammates now have daily, specific actions, along with more clearly-marked restricted areas in production. Jan. 20, 2025 Boeing teams resolved a recurring issue in 777X wing assembly by creating 3D-printed covers that protect brackets from minor damage. Previously, disposable tape left the brackets exposed, leaving them vulnerable to scratches. The new protectors are reusable and provide better coverage, resulting in no reported defects so far. Dec. 12, 2024 Boeing has improved how wires are installed in the wings of 777/777X jets by dedicating two electricians work together instead of one. The process of feeding wires through the wings can be difficult to do alone, which increased the risk of damage that could cause delays and rework. Since implementing this team approach, there has been no need for wiring rework in the wings. Dec. 9, 2024 Boeing has transitioned to a digital on-the-job training platform for new mechanics and quality inspectors. The digital system offers tailored, role-specific training plans, streamlining the process and reducing administrative tasks, which improves efficiency and ensures readiness for production. Nov. 13, 2024 Boeing has introduced a new protective tool to address scratches and tool marks on bushings -- round fittings used to join airplane components. This tool covers the bushings during assembly, preventing damage that could require replacements and disrupt production. It is installed as soon as a fuselage enters the factory and removed when the bushings are ready for use. Nov. 13, 2024 Boeing has improved how panels are installed in the 767 cargo bay. Previously, it was difficult for employees to see or know if screws were pressing into wiring on the back side – causing the potential for chafing and damage. The company now requires capped nut plates to protect the wiring from screws. Aug. 9, 2024 During a recent internal audit, engineering teams reviewed documentation related to the stow bin installation process on 737 MAX airplanes. The audit was one of many that examined airplane designs and processes. Over the course of eight weeks, teams identified opportunities to reduce defects, improve ergonomics and ensure safety and quality in stow bin installations. July 30, 2024 Boeing Commercial Airplanes has launched a training for new hires that defines a positive safety culture and emphasizes the importance of the company’s Safety Management System. The training includes in-person instruction, videos and discussions that create a personal connection to product safety and encourage employees to report hazards and prioritize workplace safety. July 19, 2024 The 787 Dreamliner has 60-70 miles of wires. Our team introduced a new wire bundle training for incoming 787 teammates to ensure that anyone working in the airplane – regardless of their role – is familiar with the basics of wiring and understand how to safely work with or around them. July 10, 2024 When an ill-fitting O-ring was discovered on a P-8 prior to delivery, Boeing engineers, mechanics and factory leaders worked together to identify the root cause of the issue. Our team discovered that two similar O-rings used near each other were easily confused, so they rewrote the installation plan in question to better identify – and keep separate – the two O-rings. There have since been no related defects found. July 8, 2024 Boeing's Fabrication teams are making improvements to how they store and transport parts to increase quality and stabilize airplane production. From adjusting cart designs to fortifying part protection measures or working with suppliers on packaging protection, the goal is to reduce damage, create safer working environments and streamline processes. June 20, 2024 An employee spoke up, triggering a quick improvement that helped standardize the work and inspections for drilling holes in small metallic fillers. These half-inch square pieces known as ‘radius fillers’ have holes drilled in the center to serve as a type of washer, but the task was difficult to execute with precision. A new drill guide was produced, and a new process was documented in the build plan, increasing efficiency, and improving first-time quality. June 11, 2024 Boeing has been enhancing the steps employees must take to remove or loosen airplane parts during production. In addition to proficiency testing, a removal history audit and the Quality team’s required approval, mechanics are required to take a new “When and Why” training to initiate a removal and ensure proper documentation. June 7, 2024 A 3D-printed tool, designed by a Boeing employee, has eliminated scrap and improved first-pass quality on placard installations for airplane interiors. Teammates install placards, which are transparent markers with adhesive that contain directives, onto curtain tracks. A new placard insert tool allows teammates to seamlessly lay the placard down onto the curtain track without needing to touch the adhesive, reducing residue or fingerprints on the adhesive. May 23, 2024 Barcoded labels are part of a pilot project helping the 737 team track parts with greater accuracy, reducing frustrating delays in finding the parts needed to complete jobs on the production line. Since mid-April when the pilot began, teams are able to locate parts in minutes instead of hours. Another advancement is the overhaul of the work-in-progress (WIP) racks where parts are stored. These racks have been made to move along with an airplane as it goes through the assembly process. May 22, 2024 Accessing the engineering drawings and installation plans required for our mechanics to build the airplane has gotten much simpler, thanks to the efforts of the Boeing Information Technology (IT) team acting in response to feedback from employees. Previously, as many as 10 clicks across multiple programs could be required by a mechanic to access the necessary documents. Implemented improvements have cut that time in half and eliminated the need to access multiple systems. May 15, 2024 A new digital platform will eliminate the need for paper training records and improve overall training on the 737 program. Individual training packets can be up to 60 pages long and are difficult to keep track of over the course of the roughly 90-day structured on-the-job (SOJT) training program. In the new digital system, an online application helps trainees track and formally document their progress, while leaders can verify who is ready for a particular job and who needs more attention and training. May 29, 2024 Through a safety risk assessment process, Boeing aims to perform more jobs in sequence and keep production lines moving to predictably deliver safe, high-quality jets to customers. As part of this pilot project, new signage is hung in 737 production areas to help teams make sure airplanes have critical jobs completed before they are considered “move ready.” Boeing is using its Safety Management System (SMS) to identify and mitigate hazards that could be disruptive to production, and employees play a key role by raising their concerns through the Speak Up portal and other means. May 9, 2024 To strengthen the training pipeline, Boeing has invested in about 300 hours of new curriculum resulting in new manufacturing and quality employees receiving up to two more weeks of foundational training, followed by enhanced its on-the-job training with more hands-on learning and mentoring from workplace coaches and peer trainers. May 11, 2024 Boeing Quality and Engineering teams implemented a new process where they perform additional inspections of nine critical build areas of widebody airplanes during the airworthiness inspection process. The new process is part of an effort to eliminate quality defects and ensure Boeing continues to deliver safe, high-quality airplanes.

The Starliner was designed to accommodate seven passengers, or a mix of crew and cargo, for missions to low Earth orbit. For NASA service missions to the International Space Station, it will carry up to four NASA-sponsored crew members and time-critical scientific research. The Starliner has an innovative, weldless structure and is reusable up to 10 times. As a reusable orbital crew capsule, Starliner’s crew modules can fly up to 10 missions. Starliner’s innovative navigation and docking system called the Vision-based, Electro-optical Sensor Tracking Assembly, or VESTA, acts as the “eyes” of the spacecraft on orbit, determining the location and orientation of the vehicle relative to the stars around it. Starliner’s Boeing Blue spacesuit is about 20% lighter than previous ascent and entry suits and still able to keep crews safe if any emergency situations develop in the cabin. As a 21st-century, fully self-flying spacecraft, Starliner will seek out the International Space Station, dock with it, undock and then safely land, all without human intervention. Launching from U.S. soil. Landing on U.S. soil. Starliner is the first orbital capsule capable of landing on solid ground, rather than an ocean splashdown. Starliner uses solar energy during flight and return, powered by solar cells on the service module’s bottom. Made by Spectrolab Inc., these cells convert sunlight into over 2,900 watts of electricity for the spacecraft. During the landing reentry phase, at 400,000 feet (121,920 meters), Starliner encounters temperatures of 3,000 F (1,649 C) from plasma caused by air friction. Its heat shield, made from Boeing’s advanced ablator, protects the spacecraft, keeping the interior around 70 F (21 C). Astronauts training on Starliner can use a portable virtual reality simulator to prepare for missions from anywhere worldwide while staying connected to Mission Control and teammates. Starliner’s crew module provides electrical power to cargo, which means it can carry up to four powered payloads or three payloads and an ISS laptop, in addition to unpowered experiments. The Starliner’s Crew Flight Test (CFT) successfully launched, docked and transported NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station. The crew manually piloted the spacecraft, demonstrating its unique capabilities. The spacecraft successfully docked to the ISS on June 6, 2024. During Starliner’s 93 days in space, teams collected additional data to support process improvements. “Calypso” became the first reused American-made orbital spacecraft to land on land, touching down on Sept. 7, 2024, in White Sands, New Mexico. The crew NASA astronaut/Starliner CFT commander NASA astronaut/Starliner CFT pilot Cargo Landing site April 16, 2024 The first Starliner to fly astronauts, named Calypso, rolled out of its factory with its crew and teammates standing by to wish the spacecraft farewell. In preparation for its return to space, Calypso was transported to United Launch Alliance’s Vertical Integration Facility at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and stacked atop its ride, the Atlas V rocket. The Crew Flight Test astronauts later practiced prelaunch procedures there, inside Starliner, ahead of liftoff. June 5, 2024 Starliner launched at 10:52 a.m. Eastern time on an Atlas V rocket with NASA astronauts Commander Butch Wilmore and Pilot Suni Williams on board. In addition to the crew, Starliner carried about 760 pounds (345 kilograms) of cargo up, including a new urine processor to replace one with a faulty pump on the ISS. June 6, 2024 Wilmore and Williams made history when Starliner docked to the forward port of the Harmony module at 1:34 p.m. Eastern time, becoming the first Starliner crew to be ferried to the ISS. The precisely choreographed flight plan to the orbiting lab included a combination of manual steering by the crew and autonomous maneuvers by Starliner. Sept. 7, 2024 Starliner returned to Earth at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time, making a bull’s-eye touchdown at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. With this arrival, Calypso became the first reused American orbital capsule to land on land. Starliner’s second Orbital Flight Test (OFT-2) launched on May 19, 2022, from Cape Canaveral atop an Atlas V rocket. After successful orbital insertion, the uncrewed spacecraft tested propulsion and navigation systems while en route to the International Space Station (ISS). Starliner performed automated rendezvous maneuvers, including fly-around and near-field tests, before docking with the ISS on May 21, 2022. NASA and ESA astronauts assisted with docking and were the first to enter Starliner in space. The spacecraft remained docked for about four days, during which cargo operations and tests were conducted. Starliner then undocked on May 25 and landed successfully at White Sands Space Harbor, completing the uncrewed mission. Cargo The flight Fully autonomous flight with commands from Mission Control in Houston. Anthropometric test device (ATD) “Rosie the Rocketeer” on board. May 4, 2022 Sitting on a transport vehicle with a top speed of 10 mph (16 kph), Starliner rolled out of Boeing’s Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. A carefully orchestrated trek took it to United Launch Alliance’s Vertical Integration Facility at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. After about an hourlong journey, Starliner was hoisted and mated to the ULA Atlas V rocket that would soon launch the uncrewed spacecraft to orbit on Orbital Flight Test-2. May 19, 2022 Starliner launched at 6:54 p.m. Eastern time atop its United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. The Atlas V’s RD-180 main engine and two solid rocket boosters generated more than 1.5 million pounds (680,389 kilograms) of thrust to lift the rocket away from the pad and across the sky. May 20, 2022 Tallyho! Starliner docked to the International Space Station for the first time at 8:28 p.m. Eastern time as the two vehicles orbited 250 miles (402 kilometers) above Earth. Demonstrating Starliner’s ability to rendezvous and connect with the orbiting laboratory on its own was a top objective of Orbital Flight Test-2. Leading the way was Starliner’s Vision-based, Electro-optical Sensor Tracking Assembly. VESTA acts as the spacecraft’s eyes, determining its location relative to the stars. May 25, 2022 Starliner landed at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico at 6:49 p.m. Eastern time. The spacecraft touched down in a safe, stable position after completing all of its undocking, deorbit, reentry and landing maneuvers. It orbited Earth 94 times, covered a distance of more than 2.4 million miles (3.9 million kilometers), and achieved all its test objectives for OFT-2, paving the way for crewed flights. Starliner’s first mission to orbit, Orbital Flight Test (OFT-1), launched on Dec. 20, 2019, from Cape Canaveral atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. An internal timer anomaly caused the spacecraft to miss its orbital insertion burn, but mission controllers placed it in a stable lower orbit. NASA and Boeing decided to skip docking with the ISS and focused on an early return while completing other objectives. Despite the shortened mission, Starliner performed well during launch, orbit, reentry and landing, validating key subsystems. Boeing and NASA conducted thorough postflight reviews and improvements, sharing lessons learned to enhance human spaceflight safety. Boeing also committed to flying another uncrewed mission at no cost to taxpayers to further demonstrate Starliner’s quality and reusability. Orbit Orbited the Earth 33 times and covered a total distance of 854,367 miles (1.4 million kilometers). Nov. 21, 2019 In the middle of the night and surrounded by employees, Starliner rolled out of Boeing’s Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility to begin mating operations. It was lifted atop United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station’s Space Launch Complex 41 ahead of the first uncrewed Orbital Flight Test. Dec. 20, 2019 At 6:36 a.m. Eastern time, Starliner launched on its first flight. The United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket performed correctly, placing Starliner in the intended suborbital trajectory for the uncrewed Orbital Flight Test. Dec. 20, 2019 After separation from the Atlas V rocket, Starliner experienced a problem. The spacecraft’s internal mission timer was set incorrectly, causing Starliner to miss its orbital insertion burn. Quick intervention from mission controllers placed Starliner in a lower, but stable, orbit. The NASA and Boeing teams decided not to dock to the International Space Station. Instead, they focused on landing early while completing as many mission objectives as they could. Dec. 22, 2019 At 7:58 a.m. Eastern time, Starliner landed on target at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico, making history as the first American orbital crew capsule to land on land. Starliner orbited the Earth 33 times and covered a distance of more than 850,000 miles (1.4 million kilometers). Even though the mission was shorter than planned, the Starliner team completed many objectives and learned important information about the vehicle’s performance during launch, orbital flight, reentry and landing. With Starliner, nothing comes before crew safety. Our vehicle features a mix of innovative technologies, some flight-proven and heritage from other Boeing programs, and some completely new for Starliner. We built in triple redundancies across critical systems, and we pushed what’s possible for safe and efficient commercial human spaceflight.

Boeing people and products have powered giant leaps in human space exploration for over six decades. Now, with NASA’s Artemis campaign, the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket — powered by a Boeing-built core stage — will help return humanity to the moon and enable sustainable exploration of its surface like never before. NASA’s SLS is the only proven deep-space optimized, super-heavy lift rocket designed to carry astronauts and cargo to the moon in a single launch. Initially capable of sending 59,500 pounds (27 metric tons), the SLS rocket will evolve to the Block 1B configuration with the more-powerful Exploration Upper Stage, allowing it to send more than 83,000 pounds (38 metric tons) to destinations beyond the moon. With greater payload volume and lifting power, SLS is set to take us farther — and faster — than we’ve ever gone before. SLS can make possible NASA’s goal of a sustainable presence on the moon. Insights gained from these missions will enable astronauts to take the next giant leap — to Mars. (NASA Image) SLS can support a near-term Mars flyby mission by leveraging a rare, once-every-15-years alignment of the planets. A human flyby can be achieved within the capabilities of systems we are currently building. SLS can enable the search for life on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, including exploring their surface, sampling geysers and investigating the liquid hydrocarbon lakes to learn more about our solar system. SLS can launch big telescopes with monolithic mirrors up to 26 feet (8 meters) in diameter, or even larger segmented mirrors, capable of reading the radiation wavelengths from exoplanets to identify signs of life. SLS can deliver the largest science payloads faster than other rockets, reaching Saturn in six years. It can send an Interstellar Explorer to interstellar space in just 15 years, covering 18 billion miles (29 billion kilometers). SLS can protect our planet by redirecting a potentially dangerous asteroid, which will depend on delivering a large mass as quickly as possible to the target. New explorers are going to the moon to make discoveries that will pave the way for future missions to Mars and beyond. NASA’s Artemis missions, named for Apollo’s twin sister, will demonstrate America’s commitment and capability to extend human existence to deep space, for the benefit of life on Earth. Artemis II is the second deep space mission for the campaign and will return humans to lunar orbit for the first time in 50 years. During the Artemis II mission, NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket will propel the crewed Orion spacecraft out of Earth’s atmosphere to travel around the moon and back.

Artemis I marks the first deep-space mission to the moon since Apollo, ushering in a new era of scientific discovery, economic benefits and inspiration. During the Artemis I mission, NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket propels an uncrewed Orion spacecraft out of Earth’s atmosphere, allowing it to travel around the moon and back. Launch speed (24,500 mph or 39,380 kph) Total distance traveled (2.25 million kilometers) Mission duration Jan. 8, 2020 NASA declared the SLS core stage for Artemis I complete on Dec. 9, 2019, at the agency’s Michoud Assembly Facility. The New Orleans factory is where Boeing created a production system to build the SLS core and upper stages and avionics and to complete preliminary testing. After checkouts, employees escorted the first core stage to NASA’s Pegasus barge. It was the first time a completed rocket stage had shipped out of Michoud since the Apollo program. Jan. 21-22, 2020 The Artemis I core stage traveled from NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans to NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, for testing on the B-2 Test Stand used in the Apollo and shuttle eras. Boeing teams prepared the massive stand to receive the 212-foot (65-meter)-tall core stage, the largest NASA has ever built or tested. After days of careful handling, the core stage was safely lifted into the stand. March 2021 The Green Run test series for the core stage took place over the next year. “Green” refers to the new hardware, and “run” refers to operating it all together. Engineers turned the components on one by one to assess the stage, then fully fueled it. Green Run culminated in an eight-minute firing of the four engines through a “launch” and “ascent” while the fully operational stage remained locked into the test stand. April 2021 Teams inspected and refurbished the core stage before removing it from the B-2 Test Stand at Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and preparing it for shipment to Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The stage traveled 900 miles (1,400 kilometers) on the NASA Pegasus barge, then was offloaded and rolled into the Vehicle Assembly Building. There, it was stacked on its mobile launcher between two solid rocket boosters. Oct. 19-20, 2021 A launch vehicle stage adapter, Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage and Orion spacecraft stage adapter were added to the top of the Artemis I SLS core stage in a series of lifts in the Vehicle Assembly Building. Tests performed during stacking included release and retraction of the rocket’s “umbilical” connections to the mobile launcher. SLS also successfully completed its design certification review. Oct. 20, 2021 Crews added the Orion spacecraft and its launch abort system on top of the Orion stage adapter to complete the launch system for Artemis I. March 18, 2022 Aug. 17, 2022 Nov. 4, 2022 Boeing and other industry partners supported NASA as it completed more tests of the Artemis I system in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and practiced launch and mission operations. Across multiple rollouts in March, August and November of 2022, NASA moved the entire rocket through the VAB’s 456-foot (139-meter) door for a nearly 11-hour, 4-mile (6.4-kilometer) trip to launch pad 39B on a 6.6 million-pound (3 million-kilogram) crawler-transporter to undergo its final prelaunch tests. April 3, 2022 April 4, 2022 April 14, 2022 June 20, 2022 The SLS rocket attempted its first three wet dress rehearsals (WDRs) in April 2022 before the successful WDR in June 2022. During these efforts, teams loaded, controlled and drained cryogenic propellants from the rocket’s core and upper stages and practiced a launch countdown. Nov. 16, 2022 NASA’s Space Launch System rocket, powered by the Boeing-built core stage, lifted off at 1:47 a.m. Eastern time on Nov. 16, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Eight-and-a-half minutes into flight, the core stage completed its mission and separated from the upper stage of the rocket, sending NASA’s Orion spacecraft on its first journey around the moon. Boeing designs, develops, tests and produces the core stage, upper stages and avionics for the SLS. Read more below about the Boeing-built elements that make up the SLS rocket. Built by United Launch Alliance and Boeing for the SLS Block 1, the ICPS delivers 59,500 pounds (27 metric tons) to the moon and will propel the Orion spacecraft on the Artemis II mission. (NASA photo) The avionics are aerospace electronics, including flight computers, power distribution, cameras and gyros in the SLS core stage. They process data and issue commands to guide the rocket’s trajectory while communicating with Orion and ground control teams. (NASA photo) The core stage supplies propellants to support engine thrust, booster force, and the weight of the Orion spacecraft and other payloads. It stands 212 feet (64.6 meters) tall, weighs 188,000 pounds (85,300 kilograms) empty, and 2.3 million pounds (1 million kilograms) when fully fueled. (NASA photo) The forward skirt is the brains of the SLS, ensuring the rocket reaches its destination. It houses flight computers, cameras and avionics. Together with the liquid oxygen tank and intertank, it forms the top half of the core stage. (NASA photo) The LOX tank holds 196,000 gallons (742,000 liters) of LOX cooled to minus 297 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 183.8 degrees Celsius). (NASA photo) The intertank connects the liquid hydrogen and LOX tanks, housing avionics and electronics that control the rocket in flight. It also anchors two solid rocket boosters. (NASA photo) The LH2 tank makes up two-thirds of the core stage. It weighs 150,000 pounds (68,000 kilograms) and has a capacity of 537,000 gallons (2 million liters) of LH2, which is cooled to minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 253 degrees Celsius). (NASA photo) The engine section attaches the four RS-25 engines, which, with two solid rocket boosters, produce a combined thrust of 8.8 million pounds (4 million kilograms) at liftoff.

Launched a series of new multimedia task aids to help operators’ maintenance crews ensure the safety of the airplanes they work on. Delivering quality with a focus on integrity, safety and sustainability is fundamental to our mission. Recognized worldwide as an industry best practice, SMS is an integrating framework for managing safety risks. Boeing’s SMS collects and monitors data to identify and reduce product safety risks. It relies on all those involved in the design, build, support and operation of Boeing products and services to speak up when they see safety risks. Product safety depends on a culture that is rooted in transparency, accountability, and every person feeling safe and empowered to speak up when they have a concern or make a mistake affecting product safety. This reporting culture is at the heart of Boeing’s Safety Management System. In 2019 Boeing established a confidential reporting channel called Speak Up for employees to voice their concerns about product quality and safety and offer ideas for how to improve. In everything we do and in all aspects of our business, safety is our foundation. We strive for first-time quality and hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards as set forth in our Code of Conduct and company policies. That commitment begins at the highest levels of the company. Read the policy Further implementing Boeing’s Safety Management System is a part of Boeing’s Safety and Quality plan. Updates on Boeing’s actions to strengthen safety and quality. Updates on Boeing’s actions to strengthen safety and quality Safety Promotion is central to Boeing’s Safety Management System because it keeps safety as a shared value. To reinforce that commitment, Boeing created the Safety Experience featuring an interactive Aerospace Safety Timeline – originally developed for employees, this tool is now available to the public. The timeline traces key moments in aerospace history from the Wright Brothers to modern space exploration as a comprehensive product safety learning and research resource. Safety is at the core of who we are and what we do. Boeing leverages its legacy of innovation and existing safety assurance practices to ensure product safety.  Safety is the primary consideration when Boeing engineers design an airplane. In addition to meeting regulatory requirements before certification, each airplane model must meet Boeing’s time-proven design standards. Often these standards are more stringent than regulatory requirements. Boeing airplanes are rigorously tested to ensure they meet or exceed design standards and certification requirements. There are many kinds of tests. For example, structural strength is ensured by static and fatigue tests. Static tests apply maximum loads or pressure to validate the airplane’s ability to carry loads far greater than would be encountered under normal operational conditions. Boeing continually monitors the performance of airplanes worldwide to identify opportunities to improve safety. In-service events are analyzed through a formal, disciplined, safety process involving Boeing experts from a variety of technical disciplines, as well as senior and executive leaders. Learn more about how fleet safety is constantly monitored Apart from airplane equipment and technology, Boeing studies and applies human factors engineering lessons to the design of commercial airplanes. Boeing human factors experts gather information about human abilities, limitations and other characteristics and apply the data to tools, machines, systems and processes. Aviation safety depends on the collaboration of industry organizations and governments. Boeing works together with these stakeholders and airline operators to continuously advance safety in all aspects of the global air transportation system. An example of this collaboration is the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST), which comprises representatives from airlines, manufacturers, labor and government. Learn more about CAST Although the industry’s safety efforts focus on preventing accidents from occurring in the first place, a great deal of effort goes into investigating accidents to ensure they do not reoccur. Boeing is committed to its role in helping all stakeholders understand the data associated with airplane accidents. Read the Statistical Summary of Commercial Jet Airplane Accidents.

Boeing in recent years has increased its strategic investments in capabilities to drive improvements in the safety of our products and services, and to contribute to the industry’s shared goal of safety. As Boeing’s second Chief Aerospace Safety Officer, I am privileged to lead teams that are strengthening the safety of our products and services, and I’m proud to share progress on long-term initiatives we started when this independent office was founded in 2021. It is well understood in our industry that continuous learning is required to achieve the highest levels of safety. The multiple ways we at Boeing are learning – and applying that knowledge – continues to expand. Our learning informs how we design and build our products, how we gather and assess operational data, and how we flow safety improvements back into our engineering processes and out to those who operate and maintain our products. Our team is the steward and integrator of the enterprise Safety Management System (SMS), which plays a significant and growing role in our company. Over the past several years we have been working to grow our enterprise SMS. Our perspective broadened after a serious accident in early 2024 involving a mid-exit door plug on a 737-9 that separated from the airplane during flight. We sought guidance – from our regulator, from our customers, from a panel of industry experts, from our own employees. We learned ways to accelerate the alignment, integration and adoption of the enterprise SMS deeper into our three business units and, importantly, far beyond our engineering function into our design, production and product support, as well as our supply chain. The SMS became a key integrating capability in each business unit’s safety and quality plan. At the same time, our teams continued to make progress on global safety collaborations, data analytics, data sharing initiatives, customer training and support programs, and other long-term investments that help raise the bar ever higher on safety. This gives me confidence that we are on the right path on our safety journey. This annual report summarizes our progress.

Launched a series of new multimedia task aids to help operators’ maintenance crews ensure the safety of the airplanes they work on. Safety is the foundation of everything we do and our teammates take that personally — knowing every decision, every detail matters and must be done with transparency and accountability. Safety is about ensuring every person who flies on, uses, operates, designs, builds or services Boeing products gets to their destination safely. Speak Up, Boeing’s confidential and anonymous reporting channel for product and services safety, quality and compliance concerns, saw strong reporting growth in 2024. Boeing had a 220% increase in total reports made in the Speak Up tool from 2023 to 2024. Boeing enhanced this system in several ways in the past year as a direct result of feedback from teammates. Specifically, employees expressed a desire for greater confidentiality when voicing product safety concerns as well as improved transparency regarding how those concerns are addressed. In response, Boeing enhanced the Speak Up channel with a more user-friendly interface that prioritizes those needs. The company increased transparency by providing those who submit reports real-time status updates on their submissions, as well as access to their own private dashboard where they can review and track their reports. Employees also now have access to a broader array of Speak Up data analytics, including volume and outcomes of reporting. To further strengthen confidentiality and independent investigations, Boeing deployed training to all personnel involved in the process. The company established a new protocol to ensure that Speak Up reports are not assigned to the direct manager of a teammate who submits a report, thus ensuring a third party evaluates and resolves the issue. Volume by Year Julie Brightwell, 737 chief project engineer In 2024 Boeing deployed required safety and quality training to nearly 160,000 employees, focused on their role in identifying and reporting potential product hazards. This video- and web-based training included real-life examples involving Boeing employees, and a discussion guide for managers to facilitate team sessions about ways to apply the learning. Boeing provided leaders and teams the tools and training needed to foster a culture that prioritizes safety, encourages communication about safety, and focuses on ongoing improvements. Across the company, Boeing conducted safety and quality stand downs focused on engaging and listening to employees. Each business deployed employee involvement teams along with senior leaders to pause operations, discuss safety and quality related topics, and solve identified issues. Boeing recognizes the need to foster among teammates a Positive Safety Culture, an environment where everyone prioritizes, communicates and continuously improves product safety. To that end, employee onboarding in the Commercial Airplanes Foundational Training Center now includes a four-hour facilitated session focused on connecting hearts and minds to the importance of each teammate’s work to the safety of Boeing’s products and services. The session highlights the role of manufacturing and quality employees as aerospace professionals who make a personal commitment to product safety. As well, employees must see a Positive Safety Culture supported by an informed and engaged management team. Boeing introduced Safety Management System and Positive Safety Culture curriculum for managers as part of a Leaders in Foundational Training program. The facilitator-led course is interactive and provides time for discussion about ways for managers to bring the concepts back to their teams. In 2024, Boeing published on its external website an interactive timeline of aerospace events and developments that shows how Boeing and the industry have applied learnings from accidents, technological achievements and people to further advance aviation safety. The timeline is just one element of a larger immersive digital learning platform called the Safety Experience. Boeing developed the Safety Experience to promote a culture of continuous learning and improvement regarding aviation safety. The platform, which launched in 2023, features a wealth of knowledge in the form of conversations with experts, video storytelling and other content that illustrates how lessons from the past continue to inform today’s innovations. The platform is a digital extension of the Safety Experience Center at Boeing in Everett, Washington, where Boeing completed upgrades in 2024. The center enables employees and visitors to deepen their understanding of Boeing’s commitment to safety. It brings together 100-plus years of industry safety practices, engineering knowledge, innovations and insights from accident investigations. Safety promotion is increased when teammates learn from peers. To that end, Boeing doubled the number of participants in the SMS Champions Program in 2024 compared with the previous year. This five-week, virtual training and development program takes a grassroots approach to fostering a Positive Safety Culture. It supports the continuous improvement of Boeing’s SMS while promoting each champion’s professional growth as they promote SMS principles in their work teams. More than 1,000 employees throughout the enterprise participated across five cohorts in 2024, and the program continues. Quarterly alumni meetings keep champions engaged and abreast of the latest developments in our SMS. In 2024, Boeing developed a comprehensive set of actions designed to improve its safety culture, increase awareness and understanding of the company’s Safety Management System (SMS), and empower employees to speak up about product safety and quality issues without concerns of retaliation. The actions were aligned with recommendations in a February 2024 report released by an expert panel operating with authority from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to review Boeing’s safety culture. The review was part of the Aircraft Certification, Safety & Accountability Act passed in 2020. Each action is either complete or substantially underway. They include: Conducted Positive Safety Culture training for specific employee and manager audiences and strengthened Speak Up reporting channel. Deployed SMS training to all employees, enhanced the SMS Champion Program and submitted Boeing’s implementation plan to meet additional requirements for the FAA’s mandatory SMS rule. Focused on increasing the capacity of and enhancing the technical excellence and independence of Boeing employees who are authorized to perform certain functions on behalf of the FAA. Hired a human factors chief engineer and continued to build our expertise around human factors related to design, manufacturing, maintenance and training. A key component of a fully integrated Safety Management System (SMS) is proactively identifying potential hazards to product safety and controlling the risks they pose. At Boeing, this work starts with the design of products and continues into the production environment. An ongoing initiative called Design Build Safety brings together teams that take a three-phased approach to ensure that engineering requirements are being translated into production of defect-free airplanes. Along the way, the teams apply the SMS Safety Risk Management practice to identify potential hazards and manage risks. Teams identified critical areas that could present potential risks during the installation process and areas where a defect, malfunction or other issue could pose a potential safety hazard for all commercial airplane models. These include major structures and key systems such as the horizontal stabilizer. For each critical area, integrated engineering and production teams conduct Design Build Audits, where they review engineering drawings, manufacturing plans, build records and service history to proactively identify areas of risks – for example, if an engineering requirement wasn’t properly translated into the build plan. The team then observes the physical build process involving these critical safety items on the manufacturing floor and documents areas of potential risk to the build, including aspects such as human factors, work instructions, inspections and tooling usage. The cross-functional team uses the audit results to analyze potential risks and develop appropriate additional controls to eliminate or mitigate those risks. The team may use engineering processes, such as Technical Design Reviews, to help determine whether enhanced controls in engineering drawings, installation plans, or even design changes are necessary to eliminate or mitigate risk to product and employee safety. Design Build Safety teams are applying the SMS Safety Assurance component to monitor and measure the effectiveness of the risk controls and operational processes. This helps to ensure that the safety objectives are being met as expected. Key performance indicators are monitored across programs and at the highest business unit leadership levels. Boeing continues to make progress on several fronts to strengthen the ODA program and improve the independence of Boeing employees selected as ODA unit members who are authorized to perform certain functions on behalf of the FAA. In coordination with the FAA, these initiatives focus on improving ODA oversight, its administration, the unit member appointment process and the development of skills. A significant portion of the initiatives focus on increasing the support system for ODA unit members and ensuring they can perform their delegated duties free from interference. Progress includes: Added ODA unit members and improved the future ODA pipeline to address retirements and to meet current needs. Completed the first full year operating under a new organization structure in which unit members report independently to functional engineering leaders who have extensive certification and safety backgrounds. Continued operations of the Office of the ODA Ombudsperson, solidifying more than two years of direct support to ODA unit members and bi-annual reporting to the Aviation Safety Committee of the Board of Directors. The ODA Ombudsperson program is the first of its kind for any major aerospace manufacturer with FAA regulatory oversight. Benefited from engineering ODA unit members helping to create and disseminate design practices in a variety of technical areas. Boeing’s design practices, which now number over 2,700, incorporate lessons learned and best practices over Boeing’s long history. Unit members also participate in technical design reviews, where frank and transparent discussions are held among engineers and independent expert reviewers. To understand the progress of these initiatives, Boeing, with FAA oversight, once again commissioned an external company to survey ODA representatives to better understand perceptions of interference and integrity culture. Of the more than 900 Boeing employees who received the survey in 2024, there was a strong response rate of 67%. When asked if they have encountered a situation where they perceived interference directed at them in the last 12 months, 8.9% indicated that they had experienced interference, down from 12.1% in 2023 and 13.9% in 2022. Among non-Boeing (suppliers) representatives, zero respondents indicated that they had perceived interference within the past 12 months, down from 3.4% in 2023 survey results. Additionally, more than 99% of both Boeing and non-Boeing unit members indicated they would know how to report a concern of interference or where to find information to report. Boeing is applying data analytics throughout the design, production and operation of the company’s products. Data analytics are a powerful part of the Safety Management System through the Aerospace Safety Analytics team and the Boeing Safety Intelligence platform, which uses machine learning algorithms and advanced modeling techniques to deliver safety insights about Boeing products and services to internal teams. The platform is focused on data that measures how Boeing’s products and services conform to designs and comply with regulatory requirements, in addition to how they perform in the fleet. Over the past year, Boeing teams continued to expand the data sources and systems monitored throughout the product lifecycle. They used artificial intelligence and machine learning to help teams proactively identify potential hazards and develop plans to address them. Examples include: The company invested in its internal audit capability to strengthen the link between safety and quality across the business units. Gaetano (Tom) Sciortino joined Boeing in late 2024 to lead the growing Internal Audit organization. In January 2025, the team began no-notification product audits at five Commercial Airplanes sites, in addition to regularly scheduled audits. Safety and Quality audits evaluate product conformance to specified technical requirements. They are aimed at revealing any systemic issues that could drive the need for process improvements. An effort to deepen the company’s technical excellence in safety-related disciplines began five years ago with the establishment of a functional chief engineer for Safety & Airworthiness. One example of that effort: In 2024, Boeing established a new Safety & Airworthiness Focused Engineering (SAFE) Lab to provide support for engineers who are developing safety artifacts as part of the certification process for products. Safety artifacts are the documents, data and analyses that serve as evidence that a particular system or component meets requirements and is safe to operate. Engineers are trained in this work through the Safety Engineering College, a curriculum of virtual courses about system safety assessments, functional hazard assessments or other safety analyses required as part of producing a safety artifact. This new centralized, online resource is designed to make it easier for engineers to access the training and resources they need to perform their roles. Downloadable solution kits provide the processes, design practices and tools needed to produce safety artifacts. When engineers need help determining whether their approach is accurate, they consult with experts at the SAFE Lab for clarification and guidance. Boeing has now engaged more than 300 airline operators in developing and implementing comprehensive, integrated solutions that further strengthen the operational safety of the global air transportation system. This includes enhanced flight crew support to more than 235 global operators via Flight Operations Representatives, highly experienced professionals who serve as advisers to air carriers’ flight operations safety programs. Boeing also continues to provide competency-based training and assessment (CBTA) for operators’ pilots and maintenance teams. The CBTA approach blends technical knowledge with skills in leadership, such as teamwork, communications and workload management – which help crews more readily apply their learning. A total of 45 customers have taken advantage of this program. To date, Boeing has conducted 17 workshops with training leaders representing 110 airline operators and 25 regulatory bodies. In 2024, Boeing expanded a series of multimedia task aids to help operators’ maintenance crews ensure the safety of the airplanes during repair. These task aids are supplemental to Aircraft Maintenance Manuals and include easy-to-follow videos and animated 3D simulations that mechanics can use while performing a repair or preparing for an upcoming task. They cover critical topics such as predictive maintenance enhanced troubleshooting and handling run-on torque -- the initial resistance encountered when threading a self-locking nut onto a bolt, a procedure vital for ensuring aircraft safety. Boeing has safety teammates stationed around the world who work with aviation stakeholders to better understand regional safety issues, identify potential safety hazards, provide direct technical assistance and foster the sharing of lessons learned. These teams collaborate with country-specific and regional stakeholders to create a safer and more efficient global aviation system. One example is sponsoring safety management system training as part of critical personnel training and development. Another example is the creation of regional safety information-sharing groups dedicated to operators of Boeing aircraft; these venues provide operators the chance to learn from one another, while keeping Boeing informed of challenges and hazards seen in operations. This type of engagement with stakeholders complements a range of highly organized efforts designed to advance data sharing based on industry best practices. The collaboration among all stakeholders is essential to both identifying and mitigating hazards in the aviation ecosystem. Numerous regional entities are supported by Boeing experts around the world to foster transparency and partnership, enhancing the access to key data and maturing analyses, which is at the center of a data-driven approach to continuing to improve safety globally. For the third consecutive year, Boeing hosted a gathering of safety experts to exchange knowledge, best practices and insights on industry challenges. In February 2025, the company conducted its annual Boeing Aviation Safety Conference, bringing together nearly 300 of the brightest minds from across the aviation industry, including representatives from 90 carriers, pilot associations and regulatory agencies. The gathering provides a forum for open dialogue about common challenges and innovative solutions to further enhance aviation safety. For 56 years, Boeing has published statistics on commercial jet accidents with the goal of helping stakeholders understand and act upon data related to the safety of air travel worldwide. While the most recent edition of the Statistical Summary of Commercial Jet Airplane Accidents shows an increase in airplane accidents globally in 2024 compared to 2023 – one of the safest years on record – it also shows a continued downward trend in accident rates, hull loss rates and fatal accident rates across recent decades. For example, between the last two decades, fatal accident rates have declined by 65% while flight departures have increased by 20%. These long-term gains in aviation safety require everyone in the industry to learn from accidents and near-misses and to take proactive measures that will help keep air travel the safest form of transportation.

{"url":"https://www.boeing.com/space/quantum","title":"Quantum Technology","content":"Commercial Defense Space Services Safety Innovation Company Search Commercial Defense Space Services Safety Innovation Company Q4S What is Boeing doing? The importance of Quantum Quantum's potential impact What is entanglement swapping? News A quantum entanglement swapping experiment in space to lay the groundwork for a global quantum internet. Quantum technology represents one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs humanity has ever embarked on. It is rapidly evolving with potential advancements in fields as diverse as medicine, navigation, and secure communication. It can revolutionize multiple aspects of our society. Boeing is making a big bet on quantum, launching a self-funded quantum entanglement swapping demonstration satellite. The Q4S mission – slated for launch in 2026 – highlights Boeing’s desire to push the boundaries of quantum technology and its applications. The year-long Q4S demonstration involves two entangled-photon pair sources housed within the space vehicle. These sources create the needed quantum states which are manipulated by precision optics to entangle the appropriate photons. Onboard single-photon-sensitive detectors measure the photons to ensure the swap has taken place, with frequent data downlinks for program scientists to analyze.  Our payload and technology partner, HRL, has made significant advancements in benchtop exercises as we improve our technical designs and progress towards launch.  HRL is well known for their cutting-edge research in quantum sciences. All this takes place on an Astro Digital Corvus satellite platform in sun-synchronous orbit. This demo aims to solidify Boeing’s role as a pioneer, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. Boeing is doing much more than participating in quantum research, we are leading the way to operationalize and scale quantum technologies for global applications.  By taking on the challenge of entanglement swapping in space, Boeing is setting the stage for a future where quantum technology enhances how we connect, protect and explore the world and beyond.  Quantum communication enables humanity to create a global network that senses and processes large amounts of data with unprecedented accuracy and precision. This power can unlock incredible potential, helping researchers gather more data about the Earth and space environments– areas where current instrument sensitivity and resolution limit progress. It also protects user data and communications because quantum communication is inherently secure. It uses the laws of physics to ensure that any attempt to intercept or eavesdrop on a communication will disrupt the signal in a way that the original parties can detect. By enabling secure, quantum-enhanced applications, such as fault-tolerant systems that reduce errors in computing, secure voting mechanisms that protect electoral integrity, and blind quantum computing which allows data to be processed without exposure, Boeing is setting the stage for a revolution in how we handle information. There are also computing applications in and from space, but those will likely be the last to emerge.  Future systems will leverage quantum information from a sensor in space that can be delivered via entanglement swapping to a quantum computer on the ground.  The precision of quantum sensors offers observability of very faint effects in space or on Earth which has immense impact on ISR, space domain awareness, and space control missions. Entanglement swapping establishes the core capability of quantum communication by allowing networks to expand beyond simple point-to-point communication. It relies on quantum teleportation – a method where the quantum state of a particle can be transferred without having to move the particle itself across the distance. In entanglement swapping, teleportation occurs between two entangled photon pairs, resulting in a shared state between particles that have never interacted. This ethereal concept – which understandably makes sense to very few people – is what Albert Einstein famously referred to as “spooky action at a distance.” It underscores the unique nature of quantum mechanics which is generally not observable in our day-to-day lives. By demonstrating entanglement swapping, we can create a scalable network where quantum information can be transmitted over vast distances, something currently limited by decoherence (the degradation of quantum information caused by external factors) and loss (where a portion of the transmitted quantum information does not reach the receiver). This advancement is crucial for global quantum networks that could connect any two points on Earth with high security and reliability. Establishing a quantum network requires the efficient routing of quantum information. Local quantum networks at the scale of buildings, campuses, or even cities are effectively implemented using fiber-optic networks. Extending the reach of a quantum network to regional, national, or global scales is limited by the transmission loss across the network. At a threshold of a few hundred kilometers, the losses in fiber-optics are greater than losses in free-space-optical channels—it becomes more efficient to transmit quantum information between telescopes than across fiber-optic cable. Airborne or orbital quantum networking nodes can extend the range of practical quantum networks. The higher the altitude, the wider the range of the quantum network. For these reasons, satellite-enabled quantum networks are viewed by the quantum networking community as a necessity for establishing a global quantum internet. Performing entanglement swapping, especially in space, involves overcoming significant technical hurdles. Quantum states are delicate, and maintaining entanglement through environmental factors like temperature and radiation presents added layers of complexity. The process requires precision engineering and first-of-its-kind technology to stabilize and sustain these states in a way that was previously thought to be impractical, if not impossible.

Why it matters: SLS is the only rocket capable of carrying crew and cargo to the moon – the first time in more than 50 years – and is built to enable sustained human missions beyond low-Earth orbit. The 212-foot (64.61 meters) Boeing-built core stage holds more than 730,000 gallons (2.7m liters) of cryogenic propellant and, working with four main engines and twin solid rocket boosters, will carry Orion through the roughly eight-minute ascent that places the stack on a moon-bound trajectory. What’s next: Following rollout, the rocket will undergo what’s called Wet Dress Rehearsal, that is – a full launch pad test that validates propellant systems, communications and countdown procedures with the vehicle in its launch configuration.

Boeing has made substantial investments in order to meet these precise and unique requirements, making the KC-46A the most advanced multimission aerial refueler in the world. The KC-46A continues to evolve for the future as we integrate cutting-edge technological capabilities that will benefit generations of service members. The only tanker to meet the stringent Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. Air Force airworthiness and performance requirements, the KC-46A is approved by the U.S. Air Force for all global mission deployments, including combat operations. With more than 100 in service globally, the KC-46A offers unrivaled interoperable capability to U.S. allied forces and international partners for mission success. Every month, the KC-46A flies hundreds of sorties and offloads more than 5 million pounds (22.7 million kilograms) of fuel to receivers globally. The proven boom and hose-and-drogue systems are capable of refueling all U.S., allied and coalition aircraft compatible with international aerial refueling procedures. The KC-46A delivers more fuel at all ranges and from shorter runways than the KC-135 aircraft it’s replacing — while utilizing less ramp space than competing tankers — ensuring mission reach from forward and austere airfields. The KC-46A boasts a fly-by-wire boom with independent disconnect and automatic load alleviation as well as both centerline and wing-mounted hose-and-drogue systems. Twenty-eight boom and drogue receivers certified, including foreign receiver clearances in CENTCOM and EUCOM supporting coalition operations worldwide for F-35, F-18, AV-8, F-16, F-15QA and P-8.  Unlike many existing tankers, the KC-46A can also receive fuel, which significantly extends the range and flexibility of global mobility and power projection maneuvers. The KC-46A boom provides a receiver envelope three times larger than the KC-135. The KC-46A’s 212,000 pounds (96,162 kilograms) of fuel capacity enables the full spectrum of refueling missions. The KC-46A's 212,000 pounds (96.162 kilograms) of fuel capcity enables the full spectrum of refueling missions. The KC-46A can convert between cargo, passenger and aeromedical evacuation modes in just two hours — with cargo rollers – and is compatible with all U.S. Air Force loaders. Emergency oxygen and electrical power for medevac support included. Contains enough space for 15 crew members, bunks, storage, a galley and a lavatory. Supported by a robust KC-46 supply chain that includes more than 650 American businesses and 37,000 American workers throughout more than 40 U.S. states, the current production line in Everett, Washington, is delivering mission-ready aircraft today. The operating cost of four KC-46A tankers is the same as just three larger refuelers, so operators can have more booms in the air and bring more fuel to the fight. Built as a combat-ready tanker from day one of production, the KC-46A has a longer lifespan and a reduction in the airframe corrosion that can occur in postproduction modification. Fleet commonality and interoperability leverages economy of scale for the U.S. Air Force and allies. Based on the 767 Freighter, and paired with Pratt & Whitney PW4062 engines with 62,000 pound-force thrust per engine and 120 kilovolt-amperes generations, the KC-46A is both powerful and fuel efficient. Certified and flight-test-proven wing air refueling pods integrate Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) capability to make the KC-46A fleet a “connectivity hotspot” at the tactical edge. Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) provides integration tactical situational awareness and real-time information superiority using large Boeing 787-style 15-inch displays, allowing pilots to quickly optimize flight parameters. Electromagnetic pulse; nuclear, chemical and biological hardening; flight deck armor; along with armoring and countermeasures provide added protection. Onboard aircraft health diagnostic systems provide real-time health monitoring and improve operational availability and mission capability. As the needs of the mission evolve, the KC-46A can efficiently integrate new capabilities and advanced technology thanks to its in-line production. The Air Force and Boeing are investing in a Block 1 upgrade of additional advanced communications capabilities to further enhance the Pegasus’ data connectivity and situational awareness. Infrared countermeasures, radio frequency warning and night vision lighting for covert operations give the aircraft the defensive edge. Width 156 feet, 1 inch (47.5 meters) Height 52 feet, 10 inches (16.1 meters) Maximum Takeoff Weight 415,000 pounds (188,241 kilograms) Fuel Capacity 212,299 pounds (96,297 kilograms) Wing Air Refueling Pods 400 gallons per minute (GPM) offload rate Advanced Fly-By-Wire Refueling Boom 1,200 GPM offload rate Crew Compartment Seating for 15 crew members Cargo Configuration Eighteen 463L pallets, 10 pallets centerline configuration With 168 on contract and over 100 in service globally, the KC-46A offers unrivaled interoperability for mission success. The U.S. Air Force has been demonstrating the unmatched capability of the KC-46A and the mission readiness it brings to the fleet today. In addition to refueling support, the KC-46A delivers combat capability and data necessary in a multimission tanker for the 21st century warfighter. We’re building the only multimission tanker that’s produced in America for the U.S. Air Force and allies. A team that’s 37,000 employees and suppliers strong, with the ingenuity and tenacity to support those who serve around the world. Because refueling, connecting and protecting are missions that must be accomplished. The KC-46A is certified for 28 boom and drogue receivers, including foreign receiver clearances in CENTCOM and EUCOM supporting coalition operations worldwide for F-35, F-18, AV-8, F-16, F-15QA and P-8.

The Boeing Ethics Line (1-888-970-7171) is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week and is available to Boeing employees, suppliers, contractors, or others from the public. The Boeing Global Ethics Line is operated and staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week and is available in several countries. In addition to the Global Ethics Line, we also provide a web portal to report concerns. Boeing’s Global Compliance organization drives compliant company performance across all geographic locations, encourages integrity and transparency, and demonstrates our commitment to compliant and ethical business practices. Boeing’s Chief Compliance Officer works closely with the Board of Directors, senior company leaders, our employees, and external stakeholders to advance Boeing’s compliance and ethics culture throughout the company. Boeing is committed to ensuring compliance with applicable global laws and regulations, as well as our own internal policies and procedures. To maintain effective compliance risk management strategies and controls consistent with our deep compliance culture, Boeing builds compliance accountability, oversight, and risk management into all levels of the business. Boeing regularly assesses the effectiveness of internal compliance controls, including policies and procedures, training, data analytics and control validation. Managers and executives are accountable for compliance within the business or functional areas they oversee and, along with all employees, receive annual training on compliance risk areas specific to their work responsibilities. This includes training for a range of compliance topics (e.g. proper handling of proprietary or trade secret information and cyber security, anti-corruption, U.S. Government procurement integrity rules, and data privacy). Compliance training is reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that it is current, relevant, and effective. Under Boeing’s Compliance Risk Management (CRM) program, senior leaders are accountable for identifying, assessing, and managing effective compliance programs. Co-chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer and Controller, the Compliance Risk Management Board (CRMB) oversees enterprise compliance and is comprised of senior executives from across the company’s business units and functions. The CRMB’s charter is to create a proactive culture of compliance, integrate compliance risk management across the enterprise, drive effective and efficient compliance controls to achieve business objectives, and lead compliance risk mitigation and accountability. The CRMB evaluates the company’s most significant compliance risks and associated mitigation strategies, prioritizes the most important emerging issues for additional attention and, where appropriate, elevates issues to Boeing’s CEO and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Boeing’s CRM program also partners with the internal Corporate Audit organization to validate the effectiveness of compliance controls. As outlined in Boeing's Audit Committee Charter, the Chief Compliance Officer reports at least annually to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on Compliance Risk Management and provides regular reporting on the company's ethics and compliance program. More details on reporting and oversight functions of the CRMB can be found in the Audit Committee Charter, published on the Boeing Corporate Governance page. “At Boeing we are focused on doing our work the right way, every day. We have zero tolerance for corruption or bribery, and we are creating a culture based on transparency and accountability.” –Darrin Hostetler, Chief Compliance Officer; Vice President, Global Compliance Boeing strictly forbids bribery and corruption of any kind. It is imperative that we compete on the merits alone. Integrity is a core company value and in support of it, Boeing publishes an internal policy inclusive of anti-corruption and anti-bribery requirements and expectations applicable to employees, board of directors, and other stakeholders. Boeing also provides employees and other stakeholders detailed procedures to ensure compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other global anti-corruption laws and regulations; requires annual training related to ethics and compliance; and provides guidance and instructions on various reporting mechanisms. This guidance is clear that we must never sacrifice our ethical principles to win or keep business—that no business is worth it. Our anti-corruption program is organized into nine risk areas and includes extensive controls. These controls are tested annually through a self-assessment process as well as periodic risk-based corporate audits and external assessments to assess risk, ensure effectiveness, and identify potential enhancement opportunities. Confidential and anonymous reporting methods are provided. Retaliation against reporting parties is strictly prohibited, and action is taken against violators of anti-retaliation policies. The company also makes its employees aware of their federally protected whistleblower rights which are designed to protect employees against retaliation for reporting potential wrongdoing by a U.S. contractor or subcontractor. Boeing’s anti-corruption program is organized into nine areas, and reflects the company’s commitment to competing globally with honesty, integrity and in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Detailed policies and procedures govern each area and demonstrate the company’s zero tolerance for corruption, applicable to employees at all levels and in every location where we operate. We work with our partners, including through Boeing-appointed board members, to ensure that the joint ventures in which we participate adopt similar policies and procedures to govern their respective operation. Program risk is assessed throughout the year, and results are shared at the company’s executive council and board levels. Assessment results are used to make improvements to further strengthen the program and sustain effectiveness. Boeing employees are required to be vigilant in ensuring that any business courtesy is reasonable, lawful and fully justified under the circumstances, and does not suggest the appearance of impropriety. Company policies and procedures strictly prohibit offering any courtesy that could be misinterpreted as an attempt to gain an improper business advantage, and include elevating thresholds of management approval. Before any courtesy is offered, an employee must determine that it is lawful and appropriate and would not cause embarrassment to the company or recipient. Additionally, employees must follow strict guidelines when determining if an offered courtesy can be accepted. Employees are prohibited from soliciting courtesies, or accepting any courtesies when a real or perceived attempt is being made to influence action by Boeing. Boeing policies and procedures require that all hiring decisions be made fairly, ethically and in accordance with all relevant laws and regulations. Additional precautions, including Law Department review, are taken for hiring decisions involving current or former non-U.S. government officials, representatives of non-U.S. airlines, officials of public international organizations and their relatives. The Boeing financial management system is designed to assure, among other things, that company resources are effectively and efficiently managed and that reporting requirements are satisfied with integrity and reliability and in compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and generally accepted practices and principles. Specific to anti-corruption controls, all employees are required to maintain accurate financial records and appropriately document and obtain approval of costs and expenses. Employees may not approve expense reports for themselves or their peers. Use of company credit cards for non-business expenses is strictly prohibited. Personal credit cards may not be used for business expenses, except in very limited circumstances. Company policy prohibits falsification of accounting or other business records. Boeing makes investments in communities where employees live and work through charitable grants, in-kind donations, sponsorships, volunteer time, and memberships to various organizations to promote positive and sustainable change. Boeing policy requires that all grants, business donations, sponsorships, and memberships be evaluated for alignment with company values and ethical standards. All requests for payments or donations to support an organization or project outside of the United States are reviewed by the Law Department. Company contributions are subject to review and approval prior to offering, as outlined in the company's internal Company Contributions procedure. This addresses our internal contribution process inclusive of, but not limited to, the application process and properly vetting recipients for charitable donations, sponsorships, and more. In addition, at Boeing we maintain and monitor a Conflicts of Interest program, which requires each of us to demonstrate accountability and openness by disclosing relationships, outside activities, and financial interests that may pose a conflict of interest or affect our objectivity. Preventing or mitigating COIs is critical to operating with integrity and maintaining the trust of our partners, customers and stakeholders. Boeing recognizes that good business practices include drawing on the expertise of outside consultants and professional service providers. To ensure those relationships comply with applicable laws, the company has detailed requirements for creating, maintaining and renewing international consultant relationships. The company conducts appropriate and risk-based due diligence based on the international consultant’s statement of work, which may include geographic location, ownership, and other relevant information. The company renews that due diligence at appropriate intervals. International consultant agreements require strict compliance with applicable laws, including anti-corruption laws, and with Boeing’s ethical business conduct guidelines. Hiring, renewing or expanding the scope of work of an international consultant requires multi-layer executive management approvals and review by the Law Department. Boeing pursues mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and equity investments when such transactions align with the company’s strategic and operating objectives. All such transactions are accompanied by comprehensive due diligence to examine rigorously the books, records, corporate filings, operations and compliance history of the candidates for the transactions. Boeing policy sets out detailed procedures for review and approval of teaming agreements and other non-sales agreements with companies, including appropriate levels of due diligence to ensure compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Terms and conditions in those agreements must include warranties of compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws. Boeing maintains detailed requirements for all political activities inside and outside the United States. For activities outside the United States, Boeing policy prohibits company contributions to political candidates, political parties and party officials, and political advocacy groups. This prohibition covers both monetary contributions and in-kind donations. Across our supply chain we are united by a shared commitment to the Boeing values. Appropriate due diligence is conducted for potential suppliers, such as screening governmental and industry listings for instances of sanctions and/or other compliance concerns. The terms and conditions in all supplier agreements require that suppliers provide assurance of compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, granting Boeing contractual rights in the event of a breach, inclusive of termination rights. Additionally, company procedures prohibit employees from soliciting gifts from suppliers or having any contact with suppliers that would give rise to even the appearance of impropriety, and require all employees to comply with anti-kickback laws and regulations. For more information on our shared responsibility with suppliers please click here. Boeing enters into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S., primarily as a result of country laws and regulations, to provide economic flow back or the transfer of technology or skills to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations in those countries, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance as prescribed by country laws and guidelines. In certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from Boeing, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Even in these cases, Boeing retains the responsibility of the obligation. Boeing has dedicated departments focused exclusively on the management and execution of industrial participation commitments. Boeing has specific processes and procedures that detail responsibilities to address industrial participation activities, and receives support from other functions to complete due diligence, comply with export restrictions and prevent corruption. These teams’ training curriculums and guidance are tailored to meet all requirements, including anticorruption, conflict of interest, and business courtesies as regulated by U.S and local laws. Our relevant Terms and Conditions include anti-bribery and corruption provisions. Boeing is committed to continually developing and evolving its ethics and compliance program. One way we do this is through active participation in industry associations dedicated to furthering ethics and compliance initiatives, such as the Defense Industry Initiative (DII), the International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct (IFBEC), and the Institute of Business Ethics (IBE). These forums provide an opportunity to benchmark, exchange information, share best practices in the field, and discuss global trends in the industry.

Information collected automatically Boeing uses various digital analytics tools to collect data for metrics, fraud prevention, and service improvement purposes and to customize the content and layout of our pages for each individual visitor. Each time you visit Boeing Services, we may automatically collect certain types of information. Some examples of information automatically collected are as follows: When you visit Boeing Services and you have not otherwise identified yourself (e.g., via registration with a Boeing Service), our web servers automatically recognize your domain name, but not your e-mail address. We also collect firmographic information about your company, if you are visiting Boeing Services from your company domain. We collect the domain name and monitor general site use and traffic patterns to improve the Services that we offer. Cookies and tracers Cookies are currently the best way to effectively identify unique website visitors and understand how they navigate our Services. Cookies are small data files placed on your device by a website when you visit. Boeing uses cookies set by us or other companies for tracking purposes or to make our Services easier to use and tailored for individual users. Like many websites, we do not currently respond to “do not track” browser headers except where legally required. But with most Web browsers, you can take steps to limit tracking by erasing cookies from your device and by setting your browser to block all cookies or warn you before a cookie is stored. Cookies offer enhanced functionality to the user, but whether you allow a cookie to be placed on your device is up to you. Boeing uses, and permits service providers to use, tracking scripts or “tracers” and web beacons that recognize a unique identifier from a cookie placed on your device by another website. For example, we use a tracer to determine whether you visit our pages after visiting a site where we placed a banner ad. We also use these technologies to compile information about your website usage and your interaction with email or other communications, to measure performance, and to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image that can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. For example, we include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether our messages have been opened or interacted with and whether our mailing tools are working properly. While our cookie names will change over the course of time, they generally fall into the following categories: Service Features and Processes These cookies help us deliver Services, such as maintaining your shopping cart, processing payments, navigating around Services, and using live chat to interact with customer service representatives.

Marked by its distinctively recognizable hump, this iconic airplane is a symbol of great engineering, innovation and often noted as an outstanding work of architecture. Since production began in 1967, and the first 747-100 completed is first test flight in 1969, more than 100 customers have purchased 1,574 aircraft, logging more than 118 million flight hours and nearly 23 million flight cycles. The first 747 rolls out of the Everett factory on Sept. 30, 1968. 747-Fuselage-Mock-up The mid-1960s saw the development and introduction of many new jetliners. None, however, has matched the dramatic impact of the 747. Increasingly crowded skies and the availability of large-thrust engines added to the incentive for creating the giant 747. It all began with the 747-100, the first in the 747 Classics series, which also includes the -200 and -300 models. An aerial view of Boeing's Everett, WA factory where the 747 was manufactured. Construction on this facility began in 1966. It remains the world's largest building by volume. The first 747 takes off on its first flight Feb. 9, 1969. Attendees line up to see inside the 747 during its public debut at the Paris Air Show in 1969. On Jan. 22, 1970, the first 747 entered service on Pan Am Airlines’ New York–London route. A Boeing 747-100SP is in front and a Boeing 747-100 is in back. Boeing's 747-100SP (special performance), had a shortened fuselage and was designed to fly higher, faster and farther nonstop than any 747 model of its time.

With three decades of innovation in design and production and more than 3.9 billion passengers safely flown, the 777 family is the most successful widebody family in aviation history. More than 1,300 777s are in operation globally. In service, a 777 flies about 700 flight cycles per year on average and will operate safely for many decades before retirement As of December 2023, the 777 family has safely transported more than 3.9 billion passengers on 15.9 million revenue flights 120,000 cycles of simulated in-service conditions during rigorous fatigue testing, 3 times the design service objective The highest-cycle 777 in service has accumulated about 43,000 flight cycles since its delivery in 1997 Boeing builds all models of the 777 family at its Everett, Washington, factory. As with any program, the company has made continued improvements in the production system over nearly 30 years to improve workplace safety, quality and production operations, all with careful assessment, rigorous review and FAA oversight. One example is determinant assembly. A long-standing manufacturing methodology not unique to any industry, determinant assembly involves designing parts with certain features so that they precisely align to each other, instead of being aligned to tooling. (This is also known in industry as part indexing.) For example, two fuselage panels to be joined could each be fabricated with a pilot hole that would align the panels to each other. Boeing first tested the methodology in 777 fuselage production in late 2005, 10 years after the first 777 entered service. Boeing began planning to incorporate determinant assembly for 777 fuselages in 2013, as part of an initiative to improve workplace safety and quality in fuselage assembly. Known as fuselage automated upright assembly (FAUB), the effort also incorporated automated, guided robots to drill and install approximately 50,000 fasteners that had traditionally been done by hand. Boeing incorporated the changes in a portion of the Everett factory in 2015, fully implementing it in production by year end, under FAA oversight. After careful evaluation, in mid-2019 Boeing began changing the type of automation in the assembly of the forward and aft fuselage sections from robots to flex tracks. First developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes, flex tracks are an automated drilling technology proven effective on commercial programs such as the 787 Dreamliner and defense programs as well as in the later stages of assembly of the 777. Mechanics attach flexible tracks spanning the fuselage skin, then numerically controlled drills ride along the tracks to drill holes while the mechanics manually attach fasteners on the inside. The decision to change approaches, under FAA oversight, was driven by experience that showed flex tracks deliver higher quality, requiring less work by hand and with higher reliability, than what the robots had been capable of in the forward and aft fuselage areas. Before the decision was made to implement flex tracks, the 777 program redesigned portions of the build process with rivets and less difficult forms of fasteners. Taken together, those changes and the flex track solution improved both safety and quality over the robot technology in forward and aft as well as the pre-2015 production process. While this change sometimes is referred to as the discontinuation of FAUB, it’s notable that 777 fuselage sections are still built using automation and determinant assembly, though it is through modified means. Boeing also continues to use autonomous robotic technology to assemble the mid-fuselage section of the 777 and in other portions of production, including at the Composite Wing Center, where certain 777X wing components are fabricated, and on the Horizontal Build Line, where 777X wings are assembled. All of these applications were implemented following the same careful assessment, rigorous review and FAA oversight, and all are performing to specification, producing assemblies that achieve quality expectations and conform to design requirements. Boeing subjected the 777 to a comprehensive testing program to demonstrate the safety, performance and reliability of the design. During static testing of the 777 in 1995, Boeing validated the structure could withstand “ultimate” load, 150% of the highest loads any airplane would encounter in service. In 1995, Boeing also began fatigue testing to verify the durability of the airplane structure. One hundred computer-controlled hydraulic actuators simultaneously applied loads to the airframe to simulate all conditions experienced during typical in-service operations, including pre- and post-flight taxi, pilot maneuvers, wind gusts and cabin pressurization. At its completion in 1997, the 777 fatigue test was the most comprehensive Boeing had performed to date – 120,000 cycles, or three design lifetimes – demonstrating excellent durability. As part of the FAUB initiative, Boeing began extensive testing of determinant assembly in 2013. This included assembling an aft fuselage more than a dozen times using the methodology, ultimately performing fatigue testing on the fuselage to three times the design service life (120,000 cycles) – the same amount as for the certification of the first 777 airplane. There were no findings related to the determinant assembly process. The change to the determinant process was supported through appropriate engineering evaluations, updates to engineering drawings and oversight, and remains in place today. Either type of process – floor mounted or determinant – can have fit-up (shimming and pull-up) occurrences, and Boeing manages them appropriately to ensure product integrity regardless of manufacturing method. After nearly a decade of using determinant assembly for 777 fuselages, there have been only small, local adjustments for fit-up forces with the process, with no change to the design life or durability of the airplanes. Safety and quality are core values at Boeing. We design and build all our airplanes to meet rigorous engineering specifications and FAA requirements, ensuring compliance with safety standards. We continuously propose improvements, supported by extensive data and testing, with oversight from the FAA for approval. Our culture fosters transparency, accountability and open communication, empowering employees to speak up through our confidential reporting channel, Speak Up. Reported concerns are thoroughly reviewed, and we take action while strictly prohibiting retaliation. We are committed to maintaining the highest levels of safety and quality through open dialogue and continuous improvement. FAUB was an initiative to enhance workplace safety, quality and efficiency in 777 fuselage assembly through improvements to assembly methodology, tooling and technology. Best known for its incorporation of automated, guided robots to drill and fill fasteners, the effort also included determinant assembly, which Boeing first tested in 2005, as well as process improvements. All were subjected to careful assessment, rigorous review and FAA oversight prior to implementation in late 2015. Determinant assembly is a long-standing manufacturing methodology where parts are designed with certain features to precisely align them to each other, rather than to tooling, during assembly. For example, two fuselage panels to be joined could each be fabricated with a pilot hole used to align them to each other. This method is not unique to any one program, company or industry. Yes. This method is not unique to any one program, company or industry. Boeing carefully monitors the production system under established regulatory protocols and processes to assess issues as they arise, regardless of build methodology. The introduction of determinant assembly into 777 production followed careful planning, extensive engineering evaluations and updated engineering tolerances validated by testing, all under FAA oversight. After nearly a decade, only small, local adjustments for fit-up forces have been needed, with no change to design life or durability. Boeing first evaluated determinant assembly for 777 fuselage assembly in late 2005, ahead of extensive evaluations beginning in 2013 with the FAUB initiative. During this testing, Boeing assembled an aft fuselage more than a dozen times using the methodology and tooling, ultimately fatigue testing an aft fuselage for 120,000 cycles with no related findings. Boeing implemented determinant assembly, replacing fixed tooling, to improve workplace safety and ergonomics. With three decades of innovation in design and production, the 777 fleet has safely flown more than 3.9 billion passengers around the world. We are fully confident in the safety of the 777, which remains the most successful widebody airplane family in aviation history.

{"url":"https://www.boeing.com/commercial/777/design-highlights","title":"Boeing: 777 Design Highlights","content":"Commercial Defense Space Services Safety Innovation Company Search Commercial Defense Space Services Safety Innovation Company Boeing: 777 Design Highlights Technology Digitally Designed Aerodynamics Engine Light and durable Flight Deck Product Improvements Continuous Innovation Interior Elegant Features Award Winning 777 Interior Spacious Bins Dynamic LED Lighting Flexibility and Productivity Unmatched Capabilities Family Flexibility Longer Range More Revenue Payload ETOPS Routes Profitability Environmentally Progressive Cleaner for the Community Quieter for the Community Our Plans and Commitments Characteristics A testament to the power of digital design, the 777 integrates onboard systems, advanced materials, aerodynamics and the world's most powerful jet engines to produce the most reliable twin aisle airplane flying. By using 3-D computer aided design tools, Boeing engineers were able to design a more aerodynamically advanced and structurally efficient airplane with exceptional fuel economy. By incorporating technologies that help airlines earn more revenue, manage costs more effectively and realize high asset value throughout the airplane's service life, the 777 brings exceptional value to customer airlines and airplane investors. The advanced wing design of the 777 features a long span with increased thickness to dramatically improve airplane performance and reduce operating costs. Optimized for the greatest lift with the least drag, the advanced wing shape allows the 777 to climb quicker, cruise faster and higher, and consume less fuel during cruise. Flying at Mach 0.84—virtually the same speed as the 787 and 747-8—the 777 gives airlines the benefit of efficiency and speed. Raked wingtips were added to improve overall aerodynamic efficiency, extending each wing by 2 meters (6.5 feet). The raked wingtips help reduce the required takeoff field length, increase climb performance, and reduce fuel burn. Great aerodynamic efficiency Improved fuel efficiency and lighter weight alternative to a vertical winglet Increased speed without weight or drag penalty Advanced computational tools used to optimally design nacelle together with wing  The GE90-115B powers the 777-300ER, 777-200LR Worldliner, and 777 Freighter. The most powerful jet engine ever built, the GE90-115B owns the record for highest thrust achieved by a commercial jet engine. In addition to having outstanding performance and reliability, the GE90-115B has exceeded expectations for efficiency. Advanced alloys saved 1,450 kilograms (3,200 pounds) of structural weight on the 777. Selected for mechanical properties and for their light weight, the advanced alloys contribute to the remarkable dispatch reliability and maintenance economics of the 777. Composite materials reduced 777 structural weight by 1,180 kilograms (2,600 pounds). Resistant to fatigue and corrosion, composite materials reduce maintenance time, saving airlines money and increasing airplane availability. Thoroughly integrated displays, controls, and automation work together to enhance the pilot‐airplane interface while making flight deck procedures efficient. Large flat‐panel displays present flight information in a readily accessible form, allowing pilots to quickly analyze flight parameters for safety, schedule, passenger comfort, and economics. Electronic checklists, which airlines can customize with airline‐specific information and procedures, teams the flight crew and airplane systems together, integrates the checklist with the flight deck systems, automatically checks off items, and serves as a reminder of required operations, when combined this saves valuable minutes which translates into dollars. Adding the electronic flight bag (EFB) significantly reduces the need for paper on the flight deck and uses airplane‐to‐ground connectivity to deliver more critical information to the appropriate departments. Documents, including charts, flight manuals, aircraft and pilot logbooks, and electronic airport qualification information is downloaded electronically. The electronic flight bag enhances flight operations and reduces recurring expenses. EFB class 3 provisions are provided as part of the basic airplane. The flight deck and flight management system provide ample provision for future enhancements, such as improvements to air traffic management systems. The 777 flight deck won the Industrial Design Excellence Award from the Industrial Designers Society of America. The 777 flight deck won the Industrial Design Excellence Award from the Industrial Designers Society of America. The 777 cabin is designed to make every passenger aspire to be a frequent passenger. Comfort at every seat and convenience throughout the cabin make flying productive for business travelers, restful for leisure travelers, and enjoyable for all on board. A wide cabin and open sight lines provide the ideal setting for the airline’s signature service. High ceilings and stowage bins that virtually disappear during flight give passengers a broad vista of the spacious cabin. Passengers in window seats enjoy generous room for head and shoulders thanks to the nearly vertical sidewalls. The gentle contour of the walls, ceiling, and integrated stowage bins allows tall passengers to enter the aisle and return to their seat without stooping. The 777 is the consistent favorite of frequent fliers – defining comfort in air travel. Readers of the American Express' Executive Travel magazine, for six years in a row, have voted the 777 the best airplane for air travel. Business executives who travel frequently, averaging more than 38 airplane trips a year select the Leading Edge award winners. The 777 also won Business Traveler magazine's 'Best Aircraft Type' recognition three years in a row. These awards are testimony to the continued popularity of the Boeing 777. Generous space for personal belongings is within easy reach of every seat. Bins glide downward as they open, allowing passengers to load and unload popular roll-aboard luggage without blocking the aisles. Boarding and deboarding is quicker and smoother. Passengers relax during the flight, secure in the knowledge that their personal belongings are stowed nearby. There's no need to scramble for stowage space when passengers are confident that they will find room for carry-on luggage close at hand. The latest 777 models can be equipped with an innovative LED lighting system that can vary the intensity and hue of illumination to harmonize with the level of activity in the cabin. The dynamic LED colored lighting creates a unique ambiance during various phases of flight, thoughtfully balanced for leisure, work, or rest. Because LED lights have no filament, they last 10 to 20 times longer than then traditional incandescent lights. The 777 has a wider cabin than any competing airplane—current or planned. Airlines gain the utmost flexibility to match cabin configuration to their business strategy and market requirements. Ideal for flagship service, the 777 is also the premier choice for dense markets, where extra seats lead directly to extra revenue. More than an aesthetic triumph, the wide 777 cabin is designed to increase revenue potential and improve profit performance. Room for an additional seat in every row gives airlines the opportunity to boost revenue passenger capacity while maintaining a high level of passenger comfort. Premium accommodations The first-class cabin accommodates the latest “individual cabin” seating systems. In a six-abreast configuration, the first-class cabin provides plenty of room for the industry’s definitive premium seats. Business seating An extra seat per row in business class is a significant revenue advantage. Seven-abreast or eight-abreast seating on the 777 is equivalent in comfort to six-abreast or seven-abreast seating on competeing airplanes. The business-class cabin accomodates the latest seating configurations. Premium economy seating An extra seat per row in business class is a significant revenue advantage. Seven-abreast or eight-abreast seating on the 777 is equivalent in comfort to six-abreast or seven-abreast seating on competeing airplanes. The business-class cabin accomodates the latest seating configurations. Economy class seating In economy class, airlines can delight passengers with premium economy comfort in a nine-abreast configuration. At 10 abreast, every passenger can count on a standard economy comfort seat. Boeing twin-aisle airplanes offer full market coverage between 200 and 500 seats. Sized between the super-efficient 787 Dreamliner and the new 747-8 Intercontinental, the 777 shares an extraordinary operational commonality with Boeing twin-aisle jetliners. Airplanes can be shifted within a network while maintaining timetables, keeping profit margins strong, and satisfying high passenger expectations. The 777 gives airlines the flexibility to serve and create markets that require long range, large capacity, or a combination of the two. In fact, the 777 provides the greatest payload and the longest range of any airplane in the 300- to 400-seat category. The unsurpassed capability of the 777-200LR Worldliner and the 777-300ER give operators strategic growth opportunities to open new markets, carry more passengers and cargo in existing markets, and develop innovative ways to maximize utilization of airplane and crew resources. Airlines have only begun to capitalize on demand for point-to-point service in intercontinental markets. The 777 has both the range to fly these very long routes nonstop and the revenue payload capacity to earn a healthy profit throughout the year. Carrying lucrative cargo payloads with a full passenger load, the 777 allows airlines to supplement passenger revenues on routes where less-capable airplanes cannot carry cargo when all seats are sold. The ability to carry revenue cargo when the airplane is full is a significant competitive advantage, enabling operators to confidently negotiate cargo contracts for time-definite shipments. The 777-200LR Worldliner and the 777-300ER (Extended Range) are two long-range airplanes that Boeing developed to offer airlines additional flexibility in serving the nonstop routes that passengers prefer. The 777-300ER extends the 777 family's span of capabilities, bringing twin-engine efficiency and reliability to the long-range market. The airplane carries 396 passengers up to 7,370 nautical miles (13,650 kilometers). The 777-200LR Worldliner can connect virtually any two cities in the world nonstop. It will carry more passengers and more revenue cargo farther than any other jetliner. It also can carry a full cargo load on routes where other airplanes are payload limited.  The lower hold capacity of the 777-200ER, -200LR, and -300ER offers significant cargo revenue potential. The range of the 777 allows airlines to capitalize on this potential even with a full passenger load. The ability to carry revenue cargo with a full passenger load gives airlines the flexibility to negotiate long-term contracts for time-definite shipments.  Designed to begin extended operations (ETOPS) at delivery, the 777 quickly became the preferred airplane for busy long-distance routes, especially across the Pacific Ocean. The first twin-engine jetliner to fly the new North Polar routes between North America and Asia, the 777 has completed more than three million ETOPS flights. Recognizing the success of ETOPS flying, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) updated regulations to allow properly configured and approved twinjets to fly optimal routes between virtually any two cities on Earth. In late 2011, the new- generation 777s with GE engines received type-design approval from the FAA for ETOPS up to 330 minutes. With the range to fly ultralong- distance routes nonstop, the 777 can carry lucrative cargo payloads even when all the seats are full. It offers unrivaled flexibility to optimize frequencies on existing routes, create new nonstop city pairs, and bring a new level of efficiency to a wide range of markets. Sized between the super-efficient 787 Dreamliner and the 747-8 Intercontinental, the 777 shares an extraordinary operational commonality with Boeing twin-aisle jetliners. Airplanes can be shifted within a network while maintaining timetables, keeping profit margins strong, and satisfying high passenger expectations. Airlines also are attracted to the strong fuel economy and low maintenance costs of the 777. Generates Higher Revenue Structural efficiency is key to a long list of 777 cost savings that deliver significant profit advantages. Because weight is the main driver of fuel consumption, maintenance costs, and landing and navigation fees, operators can expect low costs on every 777 trip and for every passenger- mile. In addition, the long maintenance intervals for the 777 mean lower maintenance costs and higher airplane availability. The high degree of commonality among all 777 models gives airlines the opportunity to minimize spares, equipment, and training costs. The large and growing worldwide operational fleet ensures ample opportunity to place 777s with other operators, helping keep residual values high.

The large and growing worldwide operational fleet ensures ample opportunity to place 777s with other operators, helping keep residual values high. Today's twin-engine airplanes are the most reliable airplanes ever built. Thanks to modern engine and systems technology, twin-engine jetliners can fly point to point anywhere in the world using the routes that provide optimum fuel economy and timely service. The 777 leads the field with fewer schedule interruptions, air turnbacks, or diversions than other twin-aisle airplanes. Airplanes and crews are at the scheduled airport at the scheduled time more often, supporting robust airline timetables and operations planning. The high degree of commonality among 777 family members keeps the costs associated with introducing multiple 777 models to a fleet to a minimum. Initial provisioning costs are low because the 777-200ER, -200LR, and -300ER share more than 80 percent of spare parts requirements, more than 90 percent of maintenance tasks, more than 90 percent of ground support equipment needs, and all ramp equipment requirements. Shared maintenance procedures reduce maintenance training requirements. The flight deck is the same on all models, eliminating the need for simulator training when flight crews switch between models or fly multiple models. In fact, a simple handout is all that is needed to familiarize flight crews with minor differences between family members. Flight deck commonality reduces the training time required for pilots to transition between Boeing airplanes. Operational commonality allows pilots to apply hours flown on Boeing twin-aisle jetliners to maintain their qualification on the other models, greatly increasing pilot availability. The environmentally progressive 777 family meets stringent environmental standards for emissions. Improving environmental performance is part of the plan for all Boeing airplanes. Since the first 777 entered service, new family members have introduced a series of technology refinements that have kept the 777 family well ahead of environmental requirements. Every 777 family member easily meets all applicable environmental requirements. In fact, many models already meet future standards intended to cover the next generation of airplanes entering service. For example, all members of the 777 family beat the current Stage 3/Chapter 3 noise standards by such a substantial margin that Boeing plans to certify the entire family to Stage 4/Chapter 4 standards. Noise-limited airports often grant the 777 economical access even during restrictive periods of the day and night. The 777 operates with full revenue payloads at airports where older airplanes are payload limited or are restricted to narrow time slots. Building airplanes to be clean and quiet simply makes good economic sense. Airplanes that use fuel more efficiently cost less to operate and give airlines greater access to markets that are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations. Boeing is committed to building airplanes that meet future environmental standards. Working with engine manufacturers and fuel producers, Boeing will promote development of more efficient propulsion systems and cleaner fuels. In cooperation with air traffic authorities, Boeing will pursue more efficient operating procedures to reduce airplane fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission-on the ground and in the air. ISO 4001 of research better improvement Our environmental commitment spans the entire life cycle of our jetliners—from the offices where airplanes are designed, through the manufacturing process, to the operation and maintenance of the airplane in commercial service, and ultimately to the recycling of resources from retired aircraft. As a recognized Lean+ innovator, Boeing Commercial Airplanes has or will achieve certification for all manufacturing sites under stringent ISO environmental management standards.

Combined with the use of carbon-fiber composites in the 787 structure, these design decisions translate to lower fuel usage and reduced maintenance costs as well as longer range and greater route flexibility for airlines. Composites also resist corrosion better than aluminum and do not fatigue, which reduces inspection requirements and downtime and helps airlines keep the airplane flying more often and more profitably. With an airframe composed of about 50% composites by weight, the 787 weighs less than traditional metal airplanes — meaning less fuel to lift, cruise, climb and maneuver. This helps airlines achieve a 25% reduction in fuel use compared to the airplanes the 787 typically replaces. Boeing created a better flying experience with its 787 Dreamliner family by combining its unique understanding of how the human body reacts to flight conditions and how emerging technologies can improve those conditions Boeing’s passenger research directly shaped the 787’s cabin design. With inviting open architecture and large overhead bins, a sense of space is created that feels roomier to passengers onboard. A dynamic LED lighting system brings the full color spectrum to the inflight experience. Airlines can create branded and tailored moments for passengers onboard, like bringing the beauty of the sky inside the cabin by gently shifting light and color to mimic the natural transitions of sunrise and sunset, candlelight at mealtime and everything in between. The 787 has the largest windows of any widebody airplane flying today, so everyone onboard enjoys an outside view. Its electronically dimmable windows let passengers and crew control cabin light while preserving those views. Smoother ride technology and advanced aerodynamics minimize the bumps passengers feel during flight by automatically detecting and countering turbulence. Additionally, more attention has been paid to the level and quality of noise within the 787 cabin because noise can contribute to a passenger’s sense of fatigue. Innovative solutions like the use of serrated “chevrons” as part of the engine nacelle design along with other technologies reduce noise both inside and outside the cabin. Composites also allow the 787 cabin to maintain pressurization at an altitude of 6,000-feet (2,000 feet lower than conventional jets), reducing many physical symptoms common on long haul flights like fatigue and jet lag. The 787 also features components to enhance air quality in the cabin. By maintaining higher humidity levels and incorporating additional filtration to remove odors and contaminants, passenger comfort is further enhanced. Designed with direct input from pilots, the 787 flight deck delivers smarter, more connected flights from takeoff to touchdown. Large LCD displays, dual heads-up displays and portable electronic flight bag capability give pilots real-time data and situational awareness. A common layout and similar handling characteristics allow pilots to transition between the 787 and 777 with minimal additional training, giving airlines greater flexibility in crew scheduling and operations. The 787 has redefined long-haul travel by unlocking hundreds of new nonstop routes and connecting more cities than ever before. Pairing widebody comfort with mid-size economics, the 787 gives airlines the flexibility to open new markets, optimize networks and bring people and places closer together. 227,950 kgs (502,500 lbs) MTOW 248 passengers 254,700 kgs (561,500 lbs) MTOW 296 passengers 254,000 kgs (560,000 lbs) MTOW 336 passengers 227,930 kgs (502,500 lbs) MTOW 200-275 passengers 259,230 kgs (571,500 lbs) MTOW 250-325 passengers 260,360 kgs (574,000 lbs) MTOW 300-375 passengers 227,930 kgs (502,500 lbs) MTOW 200-275 passengers 259,230 kgs (571,500 lbs) MTOW 250-325 passengers 260,360 kgs (574,000 lbs) MTOW 300-375 passengers 227,930 kgs (502,500 lbs) MTOW 200-275 passengers 259,230 kgs (571,500 lbs) MTOW 250-325 passengers 260,360 kgs (574,000 lbs) MTOW 300-375 passengers 227,930 kgs (502,500 lbs) MTOW 200-275 passengers 259,230 kgs (571,500 lbs) MTOW 250-325 passengers 260,360 kgs (574,000 lbs) MTOW 300-375 passengers 227,930 kgs (502,500 lbs) MTOW 200-275 passengers 259,230 kgs (571,500 lbs) MTOW 250-325 passengers 260,360 kgs (574,000 lbs) MTOW 300-375 passengers 227,930 kgs (502,500 lbs) MTOW 200-275 passengers 259,230 kgs (571,500 lbs) MTOW 250-325 passengers 260,360 kgs (574,000 lbs) MTOW 300-375 passengers 227,930 kgs (502,500 lbs) MTOW 200-275 passengers 259,230 kgs (571,500 lbs) MTOW 250-325 passengers 260,360 kgs (574,000 lbs) MTOW 300-375 passengers Top Pages Explore Resources Quick Links Brand and Press Kit Legal BA (NYSE)   Copyright © 1995 - Boeing.

An intelligent assistant amplifies her analysis, producing software in seconds, breaking what once took days down to mere moments. “It feels like having another expert on your team,” Chrysilla said, referring to Code Assistant, one among Boeing’s 70-plus generative AI applications crafted to boost employee productivity. Across Boeing, cases like Chrysilla’s are multiplying. Artificial intelligence isn’t an abstract concept — it’s an everyday partner. The solutions stem from a methodical blueprint. Building Boeing’s AI pillars In an age when AI is shaking things up, Boeing has strategically restructured its processes with one centralized framework split into two central areas — one to enable Boeing’s business, the other to enable its products and customer experiences. This way, Boeing can improve productivity, foresee challenges and earn trust with customers and regulators. Abhi Seth, chief AI and data officer, and Vishwa Uddanwadiker, chief AI officer, are leading Boeing’s efforts globally. The foundational principle: Technology should enhance human capability, not replace it. This standard frames decisions to embed smart solutions, from engineering and manufacturing to supply chain and safety, and sets the guidelines for ethical AI use. It also supports initiatives that strengthen day-to-day operations — such as intelligent manufacturing and visual inspection capabilities — helping teams work more efficiently. From concept to deployment Boeing’s AI strategy thrives on trust within a secure ecosystem. In 2023, the company unveiled Boeing Conversational AI, its first large-scale generative AI platform, encouraging employees worldwide to interact securely within its digital network. The interface allows users to query company data, to ensure innovation and security go hand in hand. “We design user-friendly interfaces so employees don’t need to be data scientists or worry about their data to benefit,” Seth said. “Accessibility and security are just as important as scalability.” Across the workforce, team members are leveraging AI tools to work smarter, safer and faster, enhancing efficiency and redefining operations. The GenAI Academy has trained 8,000 employees, certifying 2,600 super users who create AI solutions. In factories, computer vision analyzes drawings, helping to improve visibility and reduce turnaround times. Across offices, AI co-pilots can save employees up to two hours daily by streamlining tasks.  SIGHT FOR SORE EYES: A before-and-after example shows an engineering drawing model enhanced with computer vision, a subset of AI technology that analyzes imagery. This solution helps ensure line mechanics can access clearer, more readable drawings. ILLUSTRATION © BOEING Impact you can see, results that matter The results are becoming clear in all corners of the company, as advancements display how AI can enhance productivity and safety when applied responsibly — a balance especially crucial in aerospace. “Small pathfinder projects created big proof points,” Uddanwadiker said. “Collaboration across subject matter experts and AI professionals is key to scaling success.” Responsible innovation by design Every AI initiative operates within a strict governance and ethics framework, helping to ensure alignment with Boeing’s AI principles of safety, reliability, explainability, privacy and human oversight. Smart models are trained to hold back when data is lacking, rather than guess. AI-enabled systems prioritize traceability, to link every response back to a trusted source. And because data protection is essential, Boeing applies an architecture designed to ensure no proprietary or regulated information leaves its secure network. Machine learning algorithms can also identify emerging hazards and safety trends, helping to enhance safety initiatives and improve aircraft performance monitoring. “Transparency and accountability aren’t checkboxes, they’re foundational values,” Uddanwadiker said. “Our edge isn’t only technology, it’s accountability.” This obligation not only builds confidence inside Boeing but also with the customers who depend on Boeing products and services. “Transparency builds trust, and trust drives adoption,” Seth said. Seeing the horizon By prioritizing AI solutions, Seth and Uddanwadiker are building resilience. “The pace of technological change is accelerating,” Seth said. “We can’t afford to lag.” As AI evolves, Boeing continues to focus on testing, learning and scaling, creating a cycle of experimentation and improvement. Research and testing initiatives use AI to simulate real-world conditions, analyze large volumes of test data, and generate insights that can shorten innovation cycles, reducing costs and risks. Future initiatives include a deep dive into agentic AI, enabling technology to perform tasks autonomously under human supervision. “Our progress in assured autonomy through U.S. government partnerships, combined with collaboration with regulators to address certification pathways — including with the EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) — helps support responsible scaling of highly automated systems under human oversight,” said Uddanwadiker. For Boeing, it’s a time to reimagine possibilities for more efficient, intelligent and trusted products and services.

A composite engineer in Port Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, Tian contributes to the use of resin infusion technology in airplane development. She works with teammates who manufacture control surfaces for the 787 Dreamliner, which is assembled in South Carolina. Unique to the Australian production facility is the team’s use of an advanced process called resin infusion. Boeing uses the technology to produce flexible and movable trailing edges for the 787. “The advanced composites enable us to produce stronger, lighter components, which improve aircraft fuel efficiency,” said Tian. Structural components made from composites can be as much as 50% lighter than those made from metal, she said. Lighter airplanes can fly farther on less fuel. After joining Boeing as a stress analyst in engineering, Tian moved to the co-located research team and embarked on postgraduate studies with RMIT University in Melbourne in advanced composite materials. “My research explored the use of radial braiding, which involves interlacing carbon fiber threads diagonally to maximize the strength of the composite material,” she said. Tian likens advanced composite manufacturing to making a cake. “You combine dry and wet ingredients and bake it to achieve a solid structure. “In composite terms, dry carbon fiber is layered up on a tool to achieve the required shape and thickness,” she said. “Then we introduce wet liquid resin and apply heat to solidify the resin, to help achieve a safe, high-quality airplane part.” Tian’s radial braiding research explored potential advancements of dry materials, creating a foundation on which to build on the balance of toughness and strength. She completed her doctorate in 2022 at RMIT University through Boeing’s Learning Together Program, which provides tuition assistance for company employees. Her findings will help engineers consider the right application of advanced braid formats in the future. “Since completing my doctorate, I’ve focused on reducing the time required to infuse and cure a part,” said Tian, estimating a 30% time reduction. “I’m also part of a team working on an automated mixing system, which will enable production teams to mix resin locally and safely deliver resin to the production line on demand.” Premixed resin falls into a class of dangerous goods that cannot be transported by air. Stored in special containers at minus 18 degrees Celsius, the resins must be transported by boat. Shipments can take two months, and the resin must remain in storage at minus 18 C after arrival. Tian estimates the amount of energy used in transportation and storage to be 50 times the energy it takes to manufacture the composite part. Mixing the resin on demand eliminates the need to transport and store the premixed resin. The components can be transported by air, at room temperature. “The automated mixing system technology is expected to be implemented into production in Melbourne next year, and we have filed two patent discoveries,” Tian said. “I love finding ways to make our processes better, and seeing it realized in production makes the effort worth it.” BY SARAH SCHUIRINGA, BOEING WRITER ALL PHOTOS: BRUCE GIBSON/BOEING Not subject to Australian Defence Trade Controls Act 2012 Top Pages Explore Resources Quick Links Brand and Press Kit Legal BA (NYSE)   Copyright © 1995 - Boeing.

Code in the cloud Didham led a Boeing team to develop a cloud-based software product that enables engineers to create and deploy web applications to ingest, store and retrieve data. Conceived as a proof of concept for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Didham and his team recognized the platform’s potential for broader applications. The versatile tool now supports 27 different applications across the company, helping teams manage data in flight sciences, loads and dynamics, structures modeling and electromagnetic effects. “Seeing the growth in the adoption of the software and witnessing its impact has been one of my proudest achievements at Boeing,” Didham said. In other work, Didham has developed an application that automates structural test planning. Beneath this curiosity for software applications and data-driven performance is an obsession with sailboat racing. Sailing: A passion and a parallel An avid sailor, Didham races a class of sailboat known as the moth. These high-performance boats use hydrofoils to lift the hull out of the water, significantly increasing speed. Didham readily recognizes the similarities between sailing and aerospace, particularly in the design and dynamics of sails and airplane wings. “A sail is effectively the same thing as an airplane wing, so there is a lot of overlap between sailing and aerospace,” said Didham, who designs and builds carbon fiber parts for his boat. In discussions with his coaches and sail designers, he talks through boat dynamics and sail properties to understand how a sail might react in different wind conditions. He’s also developed a software application that employs computer vision algorithms to analyze sail shapes, calculating variables such as chamber, twist and lift. Didham uses the app to analyze and optimize his race performance. “These variables are just as important for sailing performance as they are for the aerodynamic performance of an airplane wing,” Didham said. In sailing, sails catch the wind to create lift and propel the boat. This lift creates air turbulence, which causes resistance against the boat’s motion. This resistance is called induced drag. “Sailing is a very technical sport, and discussions about boat dynamics often mirror engineering meetings,” Didham said. “Communicating effectively with people from varying backgrounds is crucial for success, so sailing has also refined my communication skills.” “Richard consistently brings fresh ideas to the table, not just in our projects, but also in how he engages with the engineering community,” said Greg Jones, Boeing engineering manager. “His discoveries push the boundaries of what’s possible in software engineering and aerospace technology.” IQ Top Pages Explore Resources Quick Links Brand and Press Kit Legal BA (NYSE)   Copyright © 1995 - Boeing.

With successive airplane platforms, the ecoDemonstrator program takes promising technologies out of laboratories and tests them in an operational environment to solve real-world problems for airlines and passengers. Twelve airplanes have served as flying test beds for the program since it began in 2012. In 2023, Boeing expanded the program with “Explorer” airplanes that focus on short-term testing of an individual technology. Since the program began, the ecoDemonstrator program has evaluated more than 250 technologies – 28% have progressed onto our products and services, 52% are still being matured and 20% provided helpful learnings but were discontinued. A Boeing 777-200ER was the program’s latest flagship airplane, having served as the main test platform from 2022-2024. Boeing ecoDemonstrator pilots used operational procedures on approach to Boeing Field near Seattle to quantify their environmental benefits – procedures like continuous descent approaches, less flaps settings and steeper glide slope. They observed that some of these measures have the potential to save up to 800 pounds (363 kilograms) of fuel per landing on a 777-200ER (Extended Range) and reduce noise by up to several decibels. Boeing tested the enhanced capabilities of electronic flight bag application, Jeppesen’s updated FliteDeck Pro, such as an algorithm providing in-flight advisories to improve fuel consumption, and the ability to use real-time and historical data to predict taxi times. Qatar Airways Capt. Khalid Issa A M Al-Hamadi (left) joined a Boeing ecoDemonstrator test flight to preview the update. “Deep-dyed” digitally printed carpet was installed in the Boeing ecoDemonstrator cabin for performance testing.

{"url":"https://www.boeing.com/commercial/737ng/737-next-generation-design-highlights","title":"737NG Design Highlights","content":"Commercial Defense Space Services Safety Innovation Company Search Commercial Defense Space Services Safety Innovation Company 737NG design highlights Technological advancements Passenger experience Proven performance Environmentally progressive 100% 75% 25% 15% Characteristics The 737NG is the first family of single-aisle jetliners designed concurrently using 100 percent 3D digital design and manufacturing technology. Concurrent design ensured that all 737NG models enjoy maximum commonality and share the benefits of our ongoing technology and performance improvement program. Advanced navigation and situational awareness technologies gives the 737NG access to routes and approaches unavailable to less advanced aircraft. Improved takeoff and landing performance even at high elevations and on short runways provides operators greater flexibility. Passengers appreciate more room for carry-on items in bigger overhead bins. Optional features such as the latest in-flight entertainment systems, allows airlines to deliver information, customized programming, and revenue-generating content to every seat. Engine technology improvements, blended winglets and carbon brakes are among the enhancements that reduce maintenance and improve the environmental performance of the 737NG. Longer range, improved takeoff and landing performance The 737NG’s wing updated the design of the 737 Classic with greater area of more lift and an advanced geometry to reduce drag. Simpler control surfaces reduce weight and maintenance requirements, and a larger volume allows the wing to hold more fuel. * 737NG versus 737 Classic Blended winglets added to 737NG wings boosts range, payload, takeoff and landing performance and fuel economy. This allows pilots to use takeoff procedures that decrease wear and tear on engines and reduce community noise. The aerodynamic efficiency of the 737NG wing increases the speed at which the airplane can cruise economically. Improved takeoff and landing performance translates to better performance at high-altitude airports and on short runways. Commonality increases versatility By using the same efficient CFM56-7BE engine, all 737NG models have a high degree of commonality and standardization, providing opportunities for strategic partnerships, spare parts pooling, and fleet expansion. With a range of available thrust ratings, airlines can match engine performance to operational requirements for longer time on-wing. CFM International (CFM) uses advanced computer programs and three-dimensional design techniques to improve airfoils in the high- and low-pressure turbines for enhanced engine performance. In addition, CFM is improving engine durability and reducing parts count to achieve lower maintenance costs. The CFM56-7BE engine enhancement program entered airline service in mid-2011 to coincide with the 737NG airframe improvements. The 737NG flight deck incorporates a number of new technologies that enhance safety and allows air traffic controllers to grant suitably equipped 737NGs the most direct, economical routes as well as clearance to land and takeoff when weather conditions would require other airplanes to divert or stay on the ground. Familiar look and feel All Boeing flight decks feature large-displacement flight controls. Controls are interlinked so that both pilots are immediately aware of any control input — whether from the other pilot or from the autopilot. Flight deck automation can smooth the flight and relieve the flight crew of many routine tasks, while keeping pilots aware of the airplane's situation. Pilots always have full authority to fly the airplane and to make crucial flight decisions. These flight deck technologies are offered as optional features. This allows the customers to design their flight deck configuration to their specific requirements while minimizing weight and maintenance costs. With Required Navigation Performance (RNP) certified at navigation precision of 0.10 nautical miles, the 737NG qualifies for the most economical routes in busy airspace and the most direct approaches to runways restricted by noise regulations or terrain. Able to fly precise, preselected, 3D RNP flight paths without ground-based navigational aids, the 737NG can maintain punctual schedules while other airplanes follow less efficient flight paths, circle in holding patterns, divert to other airports or stay on the ground. RNP capability delivers immediate operational advantages and supports evolving efforts to minimize flight delays and improve airspace utilization. Accommodates challenging approaches Enables inclement weather operations Saves track miles 0.10 nmi RNP capability requires optional equipment Better structural efficiency Next-Generation 737 is the first single-aisle jetliner designed concurrently as a family using 100% 3D digital design and manufacturing technology. Higher quality assembly Improved servicing and maintenance The spacious, comfortable look and feel of the 737 Boeing Sky Interior is further enhanced by soft LED lighting, thoughtfully balanced for leisure, work or rest. The lighting can gently simulate a full flying day for longer flights, gradually changing through a spectrum of lighting from day into night. Because LED lights have no filament, they last 10 to 20 times longer than incandescent lights that are used on airplanes today. The LED lighting also generates less heat than conventional cabin lighting. The 737NG is able to serve more markets with a full revenue payload. All three 737NG models can fly transcontinental distances and all can be equipped and certified for ETOPS flights. The ability to assign any of the three airplane sizes to most routes gives airlines unparalleled ability to match capacity to actual demand and to respond to near- and long-term demand fluctuations. The 737NG was developed by listening to our customers to understand where we could improve all aspects of 737 operations. That collaboration allowed us to identify the right new technologies to greatly reduce maintenance costs. Travelers benefit directly from the dramatically lower maintenance requirements, as passengers on 737NGs are less likely to experience schedule delays due to mechanical issues. The 737NG was designed with the latest technology, with more than 20 airlines participating in defining designs that meet operational maintenance needs. The maintenance program was designed under MSG-3 Rev 2 requirements to optimize maintenance tasks, with an approach that utilizes a 100% digital design to verify access and removability. The 737NG design offers a flexible maintenance program with longer check intervals and more revenue flying days. The 737NG family offers airlines opportunity to optimize capacity and performance to actual demand and range requirements, while maintaining the powerful economic advantages of a single-type fleet. Operators can grow their fleets with a lower investment in parts, equipment, and training because 737NGs share a: Decreasing the noise of airplane arrivals and departures is an important measure of environmental performance, especially to communities near airports. The 737NG is quiet enough on takeoff and landing to give operators maximum flexibility to schedule flights into and out of restrictive airports, including London's stringently regulated Heathrow Airport. Noise stays within the boundary of the airport At most airports, 737NG 85-dBA noise levels stay within the airport boundary. This is the approximate noise of a truck driving along a highway. Because community noise impact is low, the 737NG enjoys access to highly regulated airports, even during restricted hours of operation. London Heathrow Airport RWY 27L Maximum thrust engines with cutback NADP 1 (ICAO-A) 85-dBA Takeoff noise contours 500-nmi mission, full passenger payload 737-700/-800/-900ER with optional winglets People want to feel that they can be environmentally responsible when they fly, whether it is to visit with family and friends, to conduct business or to explore new places. The 737NG already meets future emissions standards and surpasses current standards for noise and NOx emissions. Boeing continues to apply technology advances to make the 737NG even cleaner, quieter and more fuel-efficient. Because when it comes to the environment, less is more. Clean by all emission metrics Structural efficiency, an advanced wing and the latest engine technology help the 737NG achieve excellent fuel economy and low emissions in all emission categories. All 737NG family members beat NOx emission targets established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP)/6 by a margin of at least 20 percent. ISO 4001 of research better improvement Our environmental commitment spans the entire life cycle of our jetliners—from the offices where airplanes are designed, through the manufacturing process, to the operation and maintenance of the airplane in commercial service, and ultimately to the recycling of resources from retired aircraft. As a recognized Lean+ innovator, Boeing Commercial Airplanes has or will achieve certification for all manufacturing sites under stringent ISO environmental management standards.

Anyone who retaliates against a reporter will be subject to discipline. RTX has zero tolerance for retaliation of activities that impact good-faith reporting, and anyone engaging in retaliatory behavior is subject to disciplinary actions. The RTX Global Ethics & Compliance organization is here to provide support to the company and individual employees with navigating the complexities of the global business environment in alignment with our values. “Act with Integrity,” the RTX Code of Conduct, is intended to inspire, guide and support our best performance – individually and collectively. The Code provides information about how we should conduct our business and hold ourselves to the highest standards of business conduct. Setting standards in line with our values, the Code helps us to build a strong ethical culture and guides us to achieve our business goals with integrity. If you have an accounting, internal control, audit or other financial matter that you believe should be elevated to the Board of Directors, you may submit a confidential communication for the Audit Committee (you may submit anonymously if you wish).

At RTX, we aim to be world-class in everything we do — including our compliance with U.S. and other national laws. Every employee is responsible for ensuring that our business is conducted in compliance with these laws and with our Code of Conduct. Our Enterprise Risk Management assessments measure compliance risks, deploy risk mitigation plans and track implementation for five key areas: RTX has an aggressive antitrust compliance program that promotes and protects competition. We prohibit actions and behavior that support a company’s monopoly or unreasonably restrains competition. RTX does not offer or accept bribes, kickbacks, facilitating payments or anything of value that could improperly influence — or appear to influence — a business decision. Doing so is in direct conflict with our commitment to fair competition. We compete on the merits of our products, services and people each and every day. RTX is committed to protecting the personal and proprietary information of its customers, employees, contractors and business partners. RTX focuses on competing fairly, delivering quality products and services, adhering to government accounting and pricing requirements, and the timely and accurate submission of data to the government. As a leading U.S. importer and supplier of controlled products and technologies to the U.S. Department of War (DoW), other national defense establishments, and various domestic and international customers, RTX is committed to conducting business in full compliance with all U.S. and other national laws and regulations governing exports, imports, anti-boycotts, economic sanctions and embargoes. In accordance with recent sanctions imposed by the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and others, we have suspended operations in Russia and suspended all sales and support services to Russia’s civil aviation industry. RTX strives to earn the respect of our customers and shareholders based on the quality of our products and services as well as how we do business. We face a wide range of business and compliance risks, including those associated with corruption. It is the policy of RTX to ensure compliance by its leaders, employees and covered persons, including representatives, consultants and other contracted third parties, with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act and all other relevant anti-corruption laws. RTX has a zero tolerance policy for corrupt behavior. In standing by our principles and values, we fight corruption and support the global development of fair markets. Our success relies on abiding by our core principles — regardless of what might be seen as customary or acceptable in a given market. Our commitment to anti-corruption includes the following: RTX conducts all of its business solely on the merits. We will not bribe anyone to obtain or retain business or secure any other advantage, nor allow anyone to do so for our benefit, in any market — public or private — anywhere. As a general rule, employees cannot seek or accept any payments from anyone doing business with or seeking to do business with RTX. RTX maintains accurate and transparent books and records. All assets, liabilities and transactions must be promptly and accurately reflected, and RTX employees are strictly prohibited from ever making a deliberately false or misleading entry in our books and records, no matter how small or immaterial. RTX maintains a robust monitoring program to ensure that all of our businesses are upholding these nonnegotiable requirements. Our third-party intermediaries are subject to similar rules and will be selected after a robust due diligence process aimed at confirming their good business practices. Once on board, they will be trained and monitored. Intermediaries engaged in advocacy and sales on our behalf have limited-term contracts, which cannot be renewed without a refreshed assessment. RTX has a demonstrated commitment to various global anti-corruption initiatives, including the Global Principles of Business Ethics for the Aerospace and Defense Industry, the International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct (IFBEC) and the Defense Industry Initiative (DII). These initiatives and industry organizations focus on sharing best practices and enhancing ethics and business conduct among defense and aerospace companies. Every RTX employee receives annual ethics and compliance training. Anti-corruption compliance is shared through written communication, video-based training, live training, and targeted online and in-person training for high-risk personnel with messages encouraging employees to identify issues, ask questions and raise concerns without the fear of retaliation, emphasizing the importance of training, and providing guidance on areas of particular concern to help all employees understand key anti-corruption responsibilities and their personal role in guaranteeing compliance with anti-corruption laws. RTX regularly assesses and reviews the implementation and sustainment of its anti-corruption controls and continually reviews and assesses our anti-corruption policies, training and practices. In conducting investigations, RTX is objective, thorough and balanced. In managing risk, RTX is conservative and data-driven. We communicate lessons learned from investigations and apply robust processes and practices for continuous improvement and risk reduction. Contact the DoW Hotline RTX RTX Businesses Follow Us"}
{"url":"https://www.rtx.com/who-we-are/corporate-governance/public-activities","title":"Public Activities | RTX","content":"RTX Businesses Public Activities Overview All political activities of RTX Corporation (“RTX”) are managed from the highest levels of the Company. Under the RTX Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board of Directors has responsibility for reviewing and monitoring the Company’s conduct of government relations activities, including any political action committees. The Board undertakes this oversight responsibility directly and through its Committee on Governance and Public Policy (“GPP”), a standing committee of the Board comprised solely of independent directors. The Board receives regular briefings by management on U.S. government budget and priorities, proposed legislation, and related RTX government relations initiatives. The GPP is responsible for, among other things, reviewing and overseeing the Company’s positions and responses to significant public policy issues, including but not limited to its policy advocacy and its positions taken in legislative, regulatory and judicial forums, and reviewing and monitoring the Company’s policies and practices with respect to contributions to charitable, educational, and other tax-exempt organizations. The Senior Vice President for Global Government Relations (“SVP GGR”) leads RTX’s government relations and political activities, is a member of the Company’s senior leadership team, and reports directly to RTX’s Chief Executive Officer. The SVP GGR reports to the GPP Committee at least annually on the Company’s political and lobbying activities, including with respect to the Employees of RTX Corporation Political Action Committee (\"RTX PAC\"). The SVP GGR also works closely with the Legal, Contracts and Compliance (“LCC”) organization, including the Global Ethics & Compliance organization, to ensure the Company’s political activities comply with all legal requirements, company policies, and highest ethical standards. Together, these organizations ensure that all political activities are conducted in accordance with the standards articulated in the Company’s Code of Conduct and government relations policies relating to lobbying, political activities, and political contributions. RTX and its employees actively participate in public policy debates at the federal, state, and local levels. The Company’s government relations initiatives are intended to educate and inform officials and the public on a broad range of public policy issues in furtherance of its business objectives. These initiatives are not based on the personal agendas of individual directors, officers, or employees. Corporate political contributions RTX does not contribute corporate funds to federal, state, or local candidates, section 527 organizations, Super PACs, independent expenditures, or other communications to the general public related to the support or opposition of candidates, ballot measures, or any other election-related matters. Employees of RTX Corporation Political Action Committee RTX allows eligible employees to make voluntary contributions to RTX PAC. RTX PAC is not funded using corporate dollars. The purpose of RTX PAC is to use employee contributions to support candidates for federal office and some state offices, and for operating expenses of certain organizations, such as the Democratic and Republican Governors Associations, which are operated in accordance with Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 527. RTXPAC is governed by a Steering Committee comprised of RTX’s Corporate leadership team, leaders of the Company’s Global Government Relations organization, as well as representatives from LCC and other functions, operating in accordance with RTX PAC’s bylaws. In addition to its bylaws, RTX PAC adheres to the following principles: The Steering Committee considers the following factors in deciding the timing and amount of contributions to candidates: RTX PAC is registered with the Federal Election Commission (“FEC”) and contributes to some non-federal elections in jurisdictions where federal PACs are legally permitted to participate. All contributions made by RTX PAC are reported per the FEC's required filing schedule and as required by state or local law in jurisdictions where non-federal contributions are made. You can find a full list of all candidates and committees to which RTX PAC has contributed here. Since December 31, 2019, neither RTX nor its subsidiaries have sponsored any separate state political action committees. Trade associations In the ordinary course of business, RTX participates in, and pays membership dues to, certain trade associations. Membership in trade associations can provide a number of benefits including: facilitating the Company's ability to stay abreast of technical issues and emerging industry standards; providing educational opportunities for employees; supporting workforce development initiatives; reporting on trends relevant to the Company’s business; and engaging in public advocacy and education on behalf of the membership. Some trade associations utilize a portion of membership dues for non-deductible lobbying regarding issues of common concern to members. Under IRC Section 6033(e)(1), trade associations are required to inform contributors of the portion of annual dues, if any, attributable to lobbying expenses. RTX does not make payments to trade associations or other tax-exempt organizations that are designated for election-related purposes. A listing of 501(c)(6) associations with disclosed lobbying expenses to which RTX paid dues or made contributions of $25,000 or more during the prior year, and the portion of such payments not deductible under IRC Section 162(e)(1), are set forth in the Association Payment Listings. Lobbying activities RTX responsibly and lawfully engages in the legislative process to communicate its views on legislative and regulatory matters affecting the Company's business and its various constituencies. All contacts and communications with elected or appointed officials on behalf of the Company must be pre-approved by the SVP GGR or his designee, as a means of ensuring that such engagements adhere with applicable legal requirements and Company policies and align with RTX shareholder interests and the Company’s values. RTX has in place sound procedures to ensure the accuracy, timeliness and oversight of its federal, state, and local lobbying disclosures. Federal lobbying activities RTX’s federal lobbying activities are conducted in full compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act, the Byrd Amendment, and all internal lobbying-related Policies. As such, the Company's lobbying activities and expenses, as defined by IRC Section 162(e), are reported to the U.S. Congress on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Company files semi-annual reports detailing certain Federal Election Commission Act contributions, honorary contributions, presidential library contributions, and payments for event costs. These reports are publicly accessible at the U. S. House of Representatives Office of the Clerk and the U.S Senate Office of Public Records websites. State and local lobbying activities RTX’s state lobbying activities are subject to regulation and reporting in virtually every jurisdiction in which the company or its affiliates do business. As a general rule, the company’s state and local lobbying efforts are restricted to issues involving economic development and various business regulation issues that arise during legislative sessions in key states where the company maintains a substantial business presence.

The fifth-generation AIM-120 missile continues to meet warfighter requirements in all weather and beyond visual range. Its capabilities have been fully demonstrated in over 6,000 test shots. The AMRAAM missile packs unprecedented performance into a lightweight, cost-effective package. It uses a combination of inertial guidance, midcourse updates, and an on-board active radar to find the intended target and complete the intercept. Because of continual development and ongoing modernization it remains the gold standard for the air dominance arena. Procured by more than 40 countries, the AMRAAM missile has been integrated onto the F-15A/B/C/D/E Eagle/Strike Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, Eurofighter Typhoon, JAS-39 Gripen, Tornado and Harrier. The newest version of AMRAAM is operational on all F-35 Joint Strike Fighter variants. It is the only radar-guided, air-to-air missile cleared to fly on the F-35. The AMRAAM is truly a dual-role missile, offering operational flexibility in air-to-air and surface-launch engagements. In the air-to-air role, the weapon's advanced active guidance section and mature seeker design allow it to quickly find targets in the most challenging environments. In the surface-launch role, it is the baseline weapon on NASAMS, allowing countries to use the same missile in either role with no modifications. The AMRAAM-Extended Range missile is a new, ground-launched solution that will intercept targets at longer distances and higher altitudes. The AMRAAM-ER missile gets its boost in range from a bigger rocket motor and optimized flight control algorithms. Designed for ground-based air defense, the AMRAAM-ER missile is integrated with NASAMS for increased air defense protection in the medium-range air defense market. 14 international partners rely on NASAMS, and it has been protecting the U.S. National Capital Region’s air defense system since 2005.

The winged munition autonomously detects and classifies moving targets in poor visibility situations caused by darkness, bad weather, smoke or dust kicked up by helicopters. Poor weather and battlefield obscurants continue to endanger warfighters as adversaries rely on these conditions to escape attacks. This has established the requirement for an all-weather solution that enhances warfighters' capabilities when visibility is limited. The weapon’s seeker works in three modes to provide maximum operational flexibility: The tri-mode seeker shares targeting information among all three modes, enabling StormBreaker to engage fixed or moving targets at any time of day and in all weather conditions. The StormBreaker weapon's small size enables the use of fewer aircraft to take out the same number of targets as larger weapons that require multiple jets. The weapon can also fly more than 45 miles to strike mobile targets, reducing the amount of time that aircrews spend in harm's way. The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy have begun StormBreaker smart weapon integration activities on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft. StormBreaker is officially approved for operational use on the F-15E. Raytheon RTX Businesses Follow Us"}

It transmits imagery and position information from 60,000 feet with near real-time speed and dramatic clarity — empowering warfighters to respond quickly and decisively. The Raytheon-built EISS enables Global Hawk to scan large geographic areas and produce outstanding high-resolution reconnaissance imagery. To provide Global Hawk with its broad sensing, night vision and radar detection capabilities, EISS combines a cloud-penetrating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) antenna with a ground moving target indicator (GMTI), a high resolution electro-optical (EO) digital camera and an infrared (IR) sensor. A common signal processor, acting as an airborne super-computer, ensures that all elements work together. Complementing Raytheon's powerful sensors, multi-INT enhancements are available to supplement the aircraft's already superior electronics. These include communications, signals, and electronics intelligence capabilities (COMINT, SIGINT, ELINT) that increase the aircraft's mission adaptability. Using the coordinates of a signal's location, our military customers can engage sensors, and even weapons systems, to direct network-centric operations and intelligence.

For over 60 years, we provided the principal optical sensor (SYERS) for the USAF U-2 aircraft, and to this day we provide responsive deployed support to this critical national resource. The follow-on MS-177A was chosen to be the future sensor for the Global Hawk strategic UAV and is now being targeted in other roles for additional platforms. The MS-177 Family of Systems (FoS) sensor provides enhanced image resolution over a longer range and greater coverage area per hour than any other Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor in the U.S. military inventory. In addition to the Northrop Grumman Global Hawk, MS-177 will be able to operate from multiple other ISR platforms, satisfying military requirements for both land and maritime missions. The MS-177 is the next evolution of Raytheon’s Senior Year Electro-optical Reconnaissance System (SYERS) sensor, currently flown on U-2S aircraft. The SYERS-2 sensor pivots from side to side, while the MS-177 also squints forward and backward, enabling new imaging capabilities. The MS-177 sensor will ultimately be converted into the MS-177A and will offer further expanded spectral performance, enhancing data identification capabilities and assisting in the collation of improved and actionable intelligence. Internationally, the DB-110 fast jet pod reconnaissance system is the primary U.S. produced wide area long-range system currently in service. This EO/IR system is used by 18 international air forces, primarily aboard F-15 and F-16 tactical jets. New capabilities for international air forces include the MS-110 EO/IR system which offers a multi-spectral imaging capability now entering operational capability with two initial customers. Complementing the MS-110 is the TacSAR radar pod which allows operators to mirror the US U-2 sensor combination of both optical and SAR/GMTI capabilities. Raytheon MS-110 represents the next generation of the widely deployed DB-110 dual band airborne reconnaissance system providing day and night, wide area, long-rang imagery coverage. The MS-110 is the only U.S. fast jet recce pod currently offered to international customers. Our MS-110 system provides improved intelligence advantage over legacy systems by using: MS-110 integrates seamlessly into the existing DB-110 system CONOPS and architecture, employing common ground support equipment. The sensor is compatible with carriage on advanced fighters (US F-16, F-15 and F/A-18 as well as Gripen and other fast jet platforms), C-130s, MPA class aircraft, special mission craft and MALE UAVs such as MQ-9. Raytheon’s MS-40 Multi-spectral Reconnaissance System family of systems represents the next generation of tactical airborne reconnaissance capabilities, providing wide-area, long-range, multi-spectral imagery coverage – day or night, within a small form factor. The MS-40 provides improved intelligence advantages over legacy systems by offering: For air forces to have a true all-weather day-night capability with the ability to identify high value and moving targets under all conditions, it is critical to have a radar complement to the optical systems currently flown by most operators. Built on the operational pedigree of the DB-110 EO IR system and in partnership with Leonardo, TacSAR provides commanders with this vital component to a complete ISR capability. The TacSAR pod features the integration of the Leonardo Osprey-50 Advanced Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) into the DB-110 and MS-110 overall architecture and offers 24/7 mission effectiveness for multiple combat ISR missions. Commonality with the DB-110 and MS-110 systems include mission planning and exploitation tools, identical data link, similar flying CONOPS and select LRUs and GSE. The Osprey-50 AESA provides operators with: While no longer in series production, the DB-110 remains a cornerstone of the tactical reconnaissance capabilities of some 18 international air forces. Its wide area, long range capabilities, coupled with the responsiveness and survivability of the fast jet platform were major factors in the system becoming the most widely deployed pod in its class. In addition to fast jet applications, the DB-110 is installed on several special mission aircraft platforms and has been demonstrated on MALE UAVs such as the MQ-9. Existing operators may choose to upgrade their systems to a MS-110 configuration by replacing key optical components and several LRUs. Upgrade work may be accomplished at the customer’s home country facilities, limiting any gap in critical ISR coverage.

Andrew Lee Raytheon’s Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS) provides a 360-degree sensor suite for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. This advanced sensor capability gives F-35 pilots unprecedented situational awareness and survivability to operate and to navigate safely in any environment – from detecting missiles passively to circumnavigating severe weather conditions – in the Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) battlespace. The pilot’s helmet-mounted display (HMD) brings in data from Raytheon’ next-generation F-35 EODAS, which collects and sends real-time, high-resolution imagery to the HMD from six infrared cameras mounted around the aircraft. The 5th Generation F-35’s advanced sensors produce a wealth of new data ‒ electronic warfare signals, electro-optical and infrared imagery, missile warning cues and more ‒ all capable of creating new forms of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) and targeting information. Rather than relying on frequent maneuvers to achieve full defensive threat coverage or employing a specific formation to focus on varying sectors, pilots can see the entire operating picture through one system, resulting in a significant upgrade from fixed sensors on older aircraft. The sensors use two key components from across RTX: the strained layer super lattice (SLS) detector material (from commercial foundries) is processed using the same revolutionary manufacturing techniques to develop the GaN semiconductors in Andover, Massachusetts, which power Raytheon radars such as Patriot, SPY-6, and LTAMDS. The EODAS SLS detector material is then integrated into focal plane arrays by engineers at Raytheon Vision Systems in Goleta, California. These advancements, coupled with digital pixel technology and a digital read-out integrated circuit, give pilots a quick, high-definition picture of everything around them, culminating in a more capable missile detection system.

The Airborne Mine Neutralization System, or AMNS, is the U.S. Navy's standard for airborne mine clearance, has been designed to counter this threat. AMNS neutralizes moored and bottom mines while operating from sea- and land-based MH-60S helicopters. By using helicopters as a central platform, mine clearance has become safer. Mines are first identified by the AN/AQS-20A sonar system or other mine countermeasure assets. The AMNS then identifies the location of the mines and neutralizes the target. AMNS consists of the following removable mission equipment: The mine neutralization begins with the deployment of the Launch and Handling System (LHS) from the MH-60S helicopter. Because it's compatible with MH-60S mechanical and electrical interfaces and supports easy on/off kit reconfiguration, the LHS is easily deployed from the aircraft. The highly effective LHS integrates many diverse high-tech capabilities into a single system, including a stable platform from which to launch the neutralizer vehicle. The neutralizer vehicle is released from the LHS under the control of the sensor operator on the aircraft. The operator guides the lightweight (15.5 kg) and highly maneuverable vehicle to the target location using on-board sonar. After the target is viewed and positively identified with an on-board video camera, the operator fires an armor-piercing warhead from the vehicle to neutralize the mine. The neutralizer's state-of-the art electronics and sensors also provide a robust, high-speed fiber optic data link, track responder and echo sounder. An inert unit with strobe light, acoustic beacon and recovery section is used for training. Raytheon RTX Businesses Follow Us"}

The interceptor uses sheer force, rather than an explosive warhead, to destroy its target. Its “kill vehicle” hits threats with the force of a 10-ton truck traveling 600 miles per hour. This technique, referred to as “hit-to-kill,” has been likened to intercepting a bullet with another bullet. The SM-3 interceptor is a critical piece of the Phased Adaptive Approach for missile defense in Europe. The interceptor is being carried by U.S. Navy ships deployed off Europe’s coast and is now operational at a land-based site in Romania, further enhancing Europe’s protection. The flexibility of the SM-3 interceptor to be both land- and sea-based offers countries that do not have ballistic missile defense-enabled navies to take advantage of the incredible capacity to protect large areas of land. This is often referred to as regional defense. The SM-3 missile can cover larger areas with fewer installations, when compared to other \"lower tier\" missile defense solutions. The program has over 30 successful space intercepts, and more than 400 interceptors have been delivered to U.S. and Japanese navies. Whether on land or at sea, the SM-3 interceptor continues to excel in testing. In 2014, the Block IB variant was successfully launched for the first time from an Aegis Ashore testing site in Hawaii. Later in the year, the missile destroyed a short-range ballistic missile target during a highly complex integrated air and missile defense exercise in the Pacific Ocean. The SM-3 Block IB interceptor has an enhanced two-color infrared seeker and upgraded steering and propulsion capability that uses short bursts of precision propulsion to direct the missile toward incoming targets. It became operational in 2014, deploying for the first time on U.S. Navy ships worldwide. In cooperation with Japan, Raytheon is developing the next-generation SM-3 Block IIA interceptor. It has two distinct new features: larger rocket motors that will allow it to defend broader areas from ballistic missile threats and a larger kinetic warhead. The interceptor’s kinetic warhead has been enhanced, improving the search, discrimination, acquisition and tracking functions, to address advanced and emerging threats. The SM-3 IIA missile intercepted an advanced ballistic missile threat in its first live target test in early 2017. The flawless intercept was preceded by two successful non-target flight tests. The system participated in an international, NATO-led exercise in 2019 that simulated real-life threat scenarios. Strong cooperation between allied nations and industry helps ensure readiness to defeat complex threats around the world. The Block IIA variant is the centerpiece of the European missile defense system. It will be deployed ashore in Poland to complete Phase 3 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach.

Each day, ground stations receive vast amounts of data from satellites in orbit. Using complex algorithms, they process all of the bits and bytes received and turn them into useable information for the end users who consume this data. As the volume of data grows and new threats emerge, ground stations need to evolve and adapt. The Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution Mission Data Processing Application Framework — FORGE MDPAF for short — is a ground system framework that collects and processes data from satellites. FORGE MDPAF generates warnings, alerts and other information for combatants and eventually, civilian first responders and researchers. The ground station framework processes Overhead Persistent Infrared or OPIR satellite data from both the U.S. Space Force’s evolving Space Based Infrared System constellation and the future Next Gen OPIR constellation. It is also capable of processing data from other civil and environmental sensors. Chief Engineer Karen Casey shares what it is like to build a high profile program from the ground up while keeping the mission top of mind. The U.S. Space Force tasked Raytheon with building a framework that improves mission operations that could be operational and available to users as quickly as possible. Raytheon accepted this challenge and set out to create a simple and elegant solution providing a foundation on which best of breed technology provides a streamlined end-user experience. This new framework provides common services for the enterprise ground and communications systems that the U.S. Space Force requires for this critical national security mission. Building a robust framework of applications that would evolve for the future requires a new way of approaching solutions. Leveraging the best of commercial innovation and deep mission knowledge, FORGE MDPAF is modular, flexible, adaptable and resilient to cyber-attacks. Best of breed technology partners bring commercial innovation to this defense grade solution. Raytheon has brought together world-class technology providers to bring their technical expertise to a robust, defense grade platform that meets the U.S. Space Force’s mission objectives. FORGE MDPAF was designed using an open architecture framework, which enables a “plug-n-play” of current and future data types and sensors — immediately adding value to any mission. Defense and eventually civil and commercial users gain rapid access to data that is quickly ingested and tailored to support their special interest in a single, integrated view. Because FORGE MDPAF is being developed using a cloud based infrastructure, Space Force commanders deployed around the globe will have the ability to access satellite data cost effectively and quickly. FORGE MDPAF is being developed using a DevSecOps pipeline process to write and install new applications as new missions are added. Raytheon RTX Businesses Follow Us"}

Its data is critical to industries as diverse as agriculture, finance, transportation, insurance and energy. Raytheon’s VIIRS is a key instrument in the Joint Polar Satellite System, the nation's new generation polar-orbiting operational environmental satellite system. JPSS polar satellites circle the Earth from pole-to-pole, providing full global coverage twice a day. Because of their \"around the Earth\" orbit and ability to cover the entire globe every 14 hours, polar satellites give meteorologists detailed information on severe weather events that no other instrumentation can. There are two VIIRS instruments on orbit today – Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership and NOAA-20 (formerly JPSS-1) – and the third instrument slated for JPSS-2 is ready to go. VIIRS data supports a broad and diverse range of applications, some of which are still being discovered. In addition to providing highly detailed information on emerging global storm patterns, VIIRS generates high-fidelity sea, land and atmospheric data for a variety of other applied products, including monitoring of wildfires, drought, flooding, vegetation health, algal blooms and nighttime phenomena.

Patriot is the foundation of integrated air and missile defense for 19 nations. Since it was first fielded, Patriot has been used by five nations in more than 250 combat engagements against manned and unmanned aircraft, cruise missiles, and tactical ballistic missiles. Since January of 2015, Patriot has intercepted more than 150 ballistic missiles in combat operations around the world; more than 90 of those intercepts involved the low-cost Raytheon-made Guidance Enhanced Missile family of surface-to-air missiles. Those engagements were possible because Patriot is built on a foundation of more than 3,000 ground tests and over 1,400 flight tests. Each and every time Patriot is tested or live fired, engineers uncover new ways to further improve or enhance the system. The improvements are necessary because the threat is constantly changing and becoming more sophisticated. The result of the improvements and enhancements is that today’s Patriot is advanced, modern, and capable of defeating the full spectrum of threats. It shares the same name and basic purpose of the Patriot of the past, but that is where the similarity ends. Patriot has continually embraced new technologies to stay ahead of evolving threats. As a result, with a few small exceptions, such as heaters and cooling fans, the bulk of the system has been modernized over the past 17 years. This is possible because Patriot's architecture is flexible and designed in a manner that allows it to be continually upgraded and improved. This on-going modernization is funded by members of the Patriot partnership – a 19-nation consortium of Patriot users which has invested significantly in improvements, enhancements and upgrades over the past 20 years. Raytheon has built and delivered more than 240 Patriot fire units. Many countries have chosen to take advantage of Patriot's flexible architecture and upgraded their systems. That translates into global interoperability. Countries with Patriot can – and do – train together. And if need be, they can operate together in combat. Global Patriot has a defined growth path that will ensure the system continues outpacing the threat through 2048 and beyond.

EASA and Collins Aerospace, Formal Methods use for Learning Assurance (ForMuLA), Technical Report, April 2023 The aim of this report is to present the outcome of the collaboration between EASA and Collins Aerospace on an Innovation Partnership Contract (IPC) that investigated the use of formal methods as part of the learning assurance building block of the EASA AI Roadmap [4]. The project ran from Oct 2021 to Mar 2023. The IPC project titled \"Formal Methods use for Learning Assurance” (ForMuLA) focused on emphasizing opportunities for the adoption of formal methods techniques in the design assurance process of machine learning enabled systems. This resulted in the following key achievements: The considerations summarized in the report apply to machine learning in general, but particular emphasis has been placed on specific challenges related to neural networks. Discussion of formal methods applications are purposefully kept generic. This report does not recommend specific methods or tools, but is rather intended to motivate opportunities from a theoretical perspective. Where applicable, a reference is made to concrete methods and tools. EASA publication page PDF Fabio Federici, Davide Martintoni and Valerio Senni This paper considers the domain of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) infrastructures and the recurring need for collaboration across teams and stakeholders by means of remote access. The paper describes a secure solution beyond the traditional perimeter-based security approach, which consists of an architecture that supports multi-level authorization to achieve fine-grained access control, better scalability, and maintainability. An implementation of the proposed solution, using open-source technologies, is also discussed and covers the protection of both the network and edge domains of a complex IIoT infrastructure. Finally, the paper presents a risk-driven and model-based process that is designed to support the migration of existing infrastructures to the solution architecture. The approach is validated, taking as a reference two relevant scenarios for the aerospace industry.

Reina, Mikel Fernandez, Enrico Mezzetti, Francisco J. Cazorla, Embedded Real-Time Systems Driven by the increasing compute performance required by modern autonomous systems, high-integrity applications are moving to multi-core processors as their main computing platform. Using multi-core processors in avionics is particularly challenging since the timing behavior of the software is not only affected by its inputs but also by software running simultaneously on other cores. To address this challenge the MASTECS project has developed a methodology for multicore timing analysis together with a supporting toolset. In this work, we show the results of evaluating this methodology and tools on a representative avionics use case.

The article also presents a survey of several existing standards and guidelines related to ML in aeronautics, automotive, and industrial domains by comparing their scope, purpose, and results. Standards and guidelines reviewed include the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Concept Paper, the DEEL (DEpendable and Explainable Learning) white paper “Machine Learning in Certified Systems”, Aerospace Vehicle System Institute (AVSI) Authorization for Expenditure (AFE) 87 report on Machine Learning, Guidance on the Assurance of Machine Learning for use in Autonomous Systems (AMLAS), Laboratoire National de Metrologie et d’Essais (LNE) Certification Standard of Processes for AI, the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 4600 Safety Standard for Autonomous Vehicles, and the paper on Assuring the Machine Learning Lifecycle. These standards and guidelines are examined from the perspective of the learning assurance objectives they propose, and the means of evaluation and compliance for achieving these learning objectives. The reference used for comparison is the list of learning assurance objectives defined within the framework of AS6983 development. From this comparative analysis, and based on a coverage criterion defined in this article, only three (3) standards and guidelines exceed 50% coverage of the Machine Learning Development Lifecycle (MLDL) learning assurance objectives baseline. The next steps of this work are to update the AS6983 learning assurance objectives, improve the associated means of compliance to approach a coverage score of 100%, and offer a certification-based process to other domains that could benefit from the AS6983 standard.

Sutton, Riccardo Orizio, Thu Le Pham, Stefano Sebastio, Piotr Sobonski, Jack Boyd, Filippo Leddi and Carina Pamminger, in Cyber-Physical Threat Intelligence for Critical Infrastructures Security by John Soldatos and Isabel Praça In this chapter, challenges and approaches for effective Data Visualisation aimed at enhancing Situational Awareness in Sensitive Industrial Sites and Plants (SIPS) Critical Infrastructure are discussed. In the H2020 InfraStress project, a set of speciﬁc visualisation tools and dashboards have been developed for SIPS, including for real-time events monitoring and augmented reality. These tools have been integrated in a uniﬁed environment and with a set of other Cyber-Physical security solutions, aimed at collecting and presenting visually relevant data to users. The dashboards have been tested within the Piloting activities of the InfraStress project. In particular, in the pilot carried out at the De Puy Synthes site in Ireland (DPS), cyber-physical visualization was an important asset to enable operators to gain knowledge on the detected threats, as well as to receive advanced mitigation and reaction strategies, and therefore improve the site resilience. The first part of the article discusses the general dashboard architecture and core visualisation items (and related paradigms) as well as speciﬁcs about the DPS pilot deployment and its interactions with other InfraStress components. The second part elaborates on deployment experience that is critical in successful operation and critical site infrastructure supervision from the Cyber Physical Systems threats perspective. Finally, the article presents main user feedback and conclusions from the InfraStress pilot activities, with a particular focus on enhanced site resilience.

{"url":"https://www.rtx.com/collinsaerospace/what-we-do/industries/commercial-aviation/exteriors/ice-detection-systems","title":"Ice Detection and Protection Systems | Collins Aerospace","content":"Magnetostrictive Ice Detector (MID) Increased efficiency Compared to pilot visual monitoring for icing, a Lufthansa Airline study showed that MID reduces operation of the ice protection system (IPS) by approximately 75%. This is because pilot monitoring criteria are very conservative and often require turning on the system in temperatures too warm for icing. A reduction in IPS operation translates directly into fuel savings. Reduced operation of the ice protection system means reduced wear on components such as valves or actuators and longer time-on-wing before replacement. With a 75% reduction in operating hours, this could translate to as much as 4x the time-on-wing. Optical Ice Detector (OID) Increased efficiency Just like the MID technology, OID significantly reduces the need for ice protection system operation compared to using pilot visual cues, reducing fuel burn. In addition, the OID uses a flush window for the laser instead of a probe that sticks out from the side of the aircraft. This significantly reduces drag and the power needed for de-icing, providing even more fuel savings. Finally, OID can provide real-time information quantifying the severity of the icing condition, allowing the ice protection system to apply only the exact power needed to maintain ice-free critical surfaces instead of applying “full on” power every time. Just like the MID, reduced operation of the ice protection system means reduced wear on those components and longer time-on-wing before replacement. OID can also reduce the number of diversions/turnbacks caused by flight into icing conditions too severe for the aircraft to fly through. Without OID, the pilots need to be overly cautious in deciding whether to turn back or divert to an alternate airport. This means the aircraft can continue to its intended destination more often, eliminating the cost of extra landing fees, aircraft re-positioning, and passenger accommodations. Let's connect!"}

These systems can be configured for either crew commanded or automatic activation. Cabin/lavatory smoke detection Collins Aerospace's advanced photo-electric smoke detector features superior detection technology, minimizing false alarms without requiring changes to aircraft cabin or lavatory structures or wiring. Compliant with environmental legislation, it employs dual-wavelength technology to reduce false alarms from nuisance aerosols and enhance detection at high altitudes. The Model 3000 is designed as a drop-in replacement for the JAMCO PU90-400 series ionization smoke detectors. Control/interface electronics Collins Aerospace provides various control and interface electronics compatible with sensor and extinguisher assemblies. Their advanced technologies include microprocessor-based control electronics used in aircraft such as the C-17, MD-11, B-2, 777, Global Express, and CRJ 700. They utilize MIL-STD-1553b and ARINC 429/629 data bus communication systems, AFOLTS/BIT architecture, and extensive built-in test features. Additionally, these systems are hardened against HIRF/EMI/Lightning and incorporate micro/miniaturization through surface mount technology in smoke and flame detectors. Halotron BrX™ \"Green\" handheld cabin extinguisher Collins Aerospace offers a non-Halon fire extinguisher for use in aircraft cabins. The Halotron BrX™ (2-BTP) “Green” Handheld Cabin Extinguisher is an environmentally-safe drop-in replacement for existing Collins units. The extinguisher has passed UL 711 5B:C, 2B cold temperature and FAA MPS tests. Lavatory waste bin extinguisher The Collins Aerospace Kidde G800100 and G825100 series for Boeing and Bombardier aircraft are drop-in replacements for the Halon A800100 and A825100 units in many legacy aircraft fleets. The extinguishers activate automatically at 170°F (77°C). Inert nitrogen under pressure propels the extinguishant via discharge nozzles, which are configured by aircraft model. To extinguish the fire, discharge lasts between three and five seconds. Optical flame detection Collins Aerospace's optical flame detector (OFD) detects fires by utilizing the 4.3 micrometer infrared band to sense the infrared energy produced by CO2 molecules in a hydrocarbon fire, amplifying and processing the signal to distinguish it from non-fire sources. An optional built-in test (BIT) feature ensures full detector functionality by using an internal infrared source to simulate a fire. The 4.3µ OFD meets MIL F 23447 requirements and is FAA TSO C79 approved, protecting helicopters such as the Sikorsky S-76, S-92, and the RAH-66 Comanche. Thermal detection advanced pneumatic detectors Collins Aerospace's advanced pneumatic detectors eliminate nuisance false alarms caused by exposure to the rigors of aircraft engine environments.

In fact, RATs are responsible for saving more than 2,400 lives over the past five decades. If an airplane were to lose power, the RAT would deploy from the airplane’s wing or fuselage and rotates to extract sufficient power from the airstream to control and land the aircraft. RATs are designed to be small and have a self-governing device that limits the turbine’s speed. Collins Aerospace designs and manufactures hydraulic, electric and hybrid RATs.

We’ve designed thermal management systems that allow you to perfectly condition your aircraft’s temperature, humidity, pressure and freshness, while properly maintaining cargo temperatures. To best meet your specific air conditioning needs, we offer both pneumatic air cycle refrigeration and vapor cycle refrigeration technologies. In our pneumatic air cycle refrigeration systems, cooled fresh air mixes with recirculated air and is heated or cooled before delivering it to your aircraft compartments. Our patented condensing cycle promotes high efficiency throughout this process, reducing system weight. And sophisticated software-based controls optimizes performance. Our highly reliable air-bearing air cycle machines also lead to longer intervals between overhauls. Our vapor cycle refrigeration technology offers more efficiency and reduced weight. Electrically generates chilled air using environmentally safe refrigerants in a closed-loop system, requiring smaller and lighter components compared to a standard vapor cycle.

{"url":"https://www.rtx.com/collinsaerospace/what-we-do/industries/business-aviation/exteriors/ice-detection-systems","title":"Ice Detection and Protection Systems | Collins Aerospace","content":"Magnetostrictive Ice Detector (MID) Increased efficiency Compared to pilot visual monitoring for icing, a Lufthansa Airline study showed that MID reduces operation of the ice protection system (IPS) by approximately 75%. This is because pilot monitoring criteria are very conservative and often require turning on the system in temperatures too warm for icing. A reduction in IPS operation translates directly into fuel savings. Reduced operation of the ice protection system means reduced wear on components such as valves or actuators and longer time-on-wing before replacement. With a 75% reduction in operating hours, this could translate to as much as 4x the time-on-wing. Optical Ice Detector (OID) Increased efficiency Just like the MID technology, OID significantly reduces the need for ice protection system operation compared to using pilot visual cues, reducing fuel burn. In addition, the OID uses a flush window for the laser instead of a probe that sticks out from the side of the aircraft. This significantly reduces drag and the power needed for de-icing, providing even more fuel savings. Finally, OID can provide real-time information quantifying the severity of the icing condition, allowing the ice protection system to apply only the exact power needed to maintain ice-free critical surfaces instead of applying “full on” power every time. Just like the MID, reduced operation of the ice protection system means reduced wear on those components and longer time-on-wing before replacement. OID can also reduce the number of diversions/turnbacks caused by flight into icing conditions too severe for the aircraft to fly through. Without OID, the pilots need to be overly cautious in deciding whether to turn back or divert to an alternate airport. This means the aircraft can continue to its intended destination more often, eliminating the cost of extra landing fees, aircraft re-positioning, and passenger accommodations. Let's connect!"}

The need for sharing accurate intelligence data is critical to national security. U.S. military forces deployed throughout the world, operating in joint environments, require real-time access to actionable intelligence and information. The Department of War's response to this need is a global network in which both military and government agencies have access to time-sensitive intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) data. Collins Aerospace's solutions supporting the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) make this vision a reality. DCGS is designed to meet the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance needs of joint and combined task force commanders. This is accomplished through a scalable, modular, open architecture that enables interoperability for the collection, processing, exploitation, dissemination and archiving of all forms of intelligence. DCGS integrates new and emerging capabilities into an open architecture that is network agnostic and will enable seamless data management from tasking to collection to near real-time dissemination to the warfighter. Collins has decades of experience developing and integrating DCGS across military services, leading a diverse team of partners so that U.S. and coalition warfighters can change the course of events in hours, minutes or even seconds. Key capabilities of the this system: The DCGS-Lite program was developed by Collins with great emphasis on getting intelligence and information to and from the most remote edges of the battlefield. Mobile technologies were integrated to allow special operations teams to exploit intelligence from their far-off locations and provide near real-time reporting. Collins is able to provide the most current situational awareness data even in bandwidth-challenged environments. DCGS-Lite is able to receive alerts on enemy activity and distribute that information via tactical communications to hand-held devices on the forward edge of the battlespace. The data is also made available to the entire enterprise ensuring situational awareness at any echelon. The heart of the system is the web-based DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB), which was implemented by Department of War as the data infrastructure standard. The DIB enables the discovery of data available within the DCGS enterprise, permitting users to pull relevant data forward based on their specific needs. This system is leading the way toward providing seamless interoperability among all military services, the intelligence community and our coalition partners. DCGS-Lite not only features a robust, scalable data repository, but also hosts a geographical visualization tool known as Vega. Vega has the ability to display customized visualizations using data derived from multiple sources. Vega is an agnostic-mapping application that displays all the current formats to include imagery as a layer, eliminating the need for stove-piped visualization applications. DCGS-Lite is currently operationally deployed in several locations around the globe. Trailblazer is Collins Aerospace’s scalable, open, modular, standards-based architectural baseline and framework that is hardware and network agnostic. These features enable processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) and near-real time situational awareness across the enterprise. Node-to-node synchronization provides a single operational view across all echelons. The open architecture enables operations-intelligence convergence and paves the way for the Army’s Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE). The layered data integration approach separates applications to support incremental migration of legacy systems. Additionally, the visualization framework and user interfaces provide a consistent user experience tailored to user needs. Trailblazer merges enemy situational awareness with operational data providing a near-real time Common Operational Picture (COP) for the Commander. Collins is developing the next generation of advanced analytics that are applied to the big data challenge. Analysts will receive computer assistance to merge data from multiple sources, automating the ability to synchronize and store diverse forms. Semi-automated correlation and fusion at the petabyte scale creates relationships and context that aids in intelligence searches. Names and objects found in diverse data sets are automatically associated into a single portfolio to eliminate the need for multiple searches. The ability to normalize data among repositories will ensure that no matter where a user taps into the data, the same data will return. \"This document does not contain technology or technical data controlled under either the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations or the U.S. Export Administration Regulations.\" Collins Aerospace RTX Businesses Industries We Serve FOLLOW US"}

This is because pilot monitoring criteria are very conservative and often require turning on the system in temperatures too warm for icing. A reduction in IPS operation translates directly into fuel savings. Improved operational efficiency Reduced operation of the ice protection system means reduced wear on components such as valves or actuators and longer time-on-wing before replacement. With a 70% reduction in operating hours, this could translate to almost 4x as much time-on-wing. Optical Ice Detector (OID) Reduced environmental impact Just like the MID technology, OID significantly reduces the need for aircraft ice protection system operation compared to using pilot visual cues, reducing fuel burn. In addition, the OID uses a flush window for the laser instead of a probe that sticks out from the side of the aircraft. This significantly reduces drag and the power needed for aircraft de-icing, providing even more fuel savings. Finally, OID can provide real-time information indicating the severity of the icing condition, allowing the ice protection system to apply only the power needed to maintain ice-free critical surfaces instead of applying “full on” power every time. Improved operational efficiency Just like the MID, reduced operation of the aircraft ice protection system means reduced wear on those components and longer time-on-wing before replacement. OID can also reduce the number of diversions/turnbacks caused by flight into icing conditions too severe for the aircraft to fly through. Without OID, the pilots need to be overly cautious in deciding whether to turn back or divert to an alternate airport. This means the aircraft can continue to its intended destination more often, eliminating the cost of extra landing fees, aircraft re-positioning, and passenger accommodations. Let's connect!"}

In addition, Collins is working with NASA on the development of a certified C2 datalink to ensure standardization and the reliability of controlling UAS in shared civil airspace. In June 2013, data link waveform tests were performed that simulated communication between one aircraft and one ground-based pilot station. The objective of the test was to verify the waveform’s efficient and cooperative utilization of the radio spectrum on which it operates. Our proven automatic flight control systems provide full-mission pilotless capabilities with unsurpassed accuracy and reliability. Our controls technology is based on unique algorithms that have been developed over the past two decades. Collins’ suite of control algorithms is built on experience achieved on a variety of UAS. We package our controls technology with sensors and hardware, offering complete solutions through our Athena family of flight control and navigation products. We have demonstrated damage-tolerant flight control and autonomous landing capabilities on an unmanned subscale F/A-18 under a contract with DARPA. During separate flight tests up to 80 percent of the aircraft’s right wing was ejected to simulate battle damage and in-flight failure. Our Automatic Supervisory Adaptive Control (ASAC) technology reacted to the airplane's new vehicle configuration, automatically regained baseline performance, continued to fly the plane and then autonomously landed it using Inertial Navigation System/Global Positioning System (INS/GPS) reference only. This same capability can enhance UAS reliability for co-existing with manned aviation in civil airspace. In addition, this capability can provide autonomous backup to manned aircraft in the event of an emergency. Our redundant flight control architectures provide unambiguous detection and identification of any single-point failure within the system. Following a failure, the system autonomously reconfigures itself to ensure no loss of critical autopilot functionality. Such capabilities provide the ultra-high system level reliability necessary in an unmanned aircraft in both controlled and civil airspace.

Extensive experience in the PTMS space allows us to offer the Enhanced Power and Cooling System (EPACS) for the future of the F-35 platform. EPACS offers twice the cooling capacity and reduced engine bleed air usage, so pilots won’t have to think twice about the performance capabilities of their aircraft. EPACS would enable F-35 modernization, unlocking the performance potential of current and future fleets. Collins Aerospace has solved this problem of increased cooling demand time and time again. As a leading provider of thermal management systems, electric power generation and distribution, and auxiliary power units, we are experts on all the key subsystem functions of EPACS. By integrating these capabilities, we are applying proven solutions to support modernization of the F-35. The Boeing 787 is just one example that combines environmental control systems, electric power generation and distribution, and the auxiliary power unit. Collins designed, integrated and delivered these systems to reduce engine bleed air usage and optimize the energy usage aboard the aircraft. These systems have over 10 million cumulative flight hours and counting. EPACS uses proven, demonstrated technologies, and we’ve executed hardware prototype testing to further burn down risk. Many of the enabling technologies applied to EPACS have been fielded on multiple military and commercial systems to provide maximum cooling capacity while minimizing bleed air penalty. This allows EPACS to maximize cooling as well as increase range and thrust all while providing additional system durability benefits. With a successful lab demonstration at 80 kW on the books, EPACS remains poised to meet the cooling needs for tomorrow’s F-35. We have invested millions of dollars into our state-of-the-art thermal systems development labs which allows Collins to simulate relevant real-world conditions on a fighter, including a wide range of temperatures, pressures, air flow rates and humidity conditions. Our system and component labs have always been future-forward and equipped to evaluate new solutions in the power and thermal management space for both commercial and defense applications. Along with a large and capable manufacturing footprint that is already delivering components for the F-35 today, we are ready to meet the production, cooling and volume constraints of this thermal challenge.

Leading open systems development 2. Pushing boundaries for platform-wide optimization 3. Planning for continuous sustainment As part of the largest rotorcraft development program in the last 50 years, the U.S. Army requires nothing less than the most advanced technological solutions for Future Vertical Lift (FVL). While there are several challenging requirements, there are three critical elements that will help secure overmatch for the FVL program as well as ensure current fleet modernization realizes the goals and value of these transformational advances. The development of a modular open systems approach (MOSA) remains a marquee requirement for FVL, ensuring the highest level of multi-domain battlespace connectivity and enabling faster integration of system technology as the mission evolves. It’s more than concept, however. Best-in-class suppliers need to demonstrate fully MOSA compliant systems – inclusive of integrated multi-vendor demonstrations – in order to supply the warfighter a foundation for a best-in-class digital ecosystem and satisfy the Army’s “fly before you buy” procurement strategy. Our Huntsville, Alabama, Collins Aerospace site hosts a MOSA Center of Excellence inside our Customer Experience Center where we invite industry partners to test and demonstrate emerging open systems technology. It’s that industry-wide collaboration that is needed to develop the best-in-breed open systems architectures for this program and beyond. Open systems are not only key to developing seamless upgrades for FVL, they also provide an important modernization and growth pathway for the entire FVL ecosystem, including current fleet platforms and launched effects. Legacy Army platforms like the Black Hawk, Chinook and Apache will benefit from current and future upgrades developed for FVL, as those platforms remain in service for decades to come. The FVL platforms will need to deliver on speed, range and payload capacity like never before. This will require transformational solutions across the platform that reduce weight and drag to ensure optimal performance. From the materials used in design to the unique integration of systems and structures, nothing is off the table to optimize FVL performance. Companies must challenge the status quo by leveraging multiple capabilities in different ways. Integrating systems across conventional product categories and boundaries, revolutionizing development with advanced materials, and eliminating waste from outdated product designs are just a few of the ways to reduce weight and drag and empower superior performance for FVL, not to mention significant potential cost savings in doing so. With countless new interoperable technologies being developed for the FVL program, long-term plans for sustainment and advancement must be included to ensure the longevity of the FVL fleets. The backwards compatibility of these technologies for the Army’s current fleet is also a major consideration surrounding the technological advancements for FVL. Strategic sustainment partnerships enable building supportability roadmaps now to avoid costly or inefficient infrastructure development in the future. RTX offers a host of capabilities to help the U.S. Army execute on these key success factors, leveraging expertise from throughout the organization to drive innovations and support meeting or exceeding requirements for Future Vertical Lift and current fleet modernization.

Lockheed Martin currently produces the F-35 and leads the international supply chain, leads the team for the development and implementation of technology solutions for the new USAF Space Fence (AFSSS replacement),[1] and is the primary contractor for the development of the Orion command module.[1] The company also invests in healthcare systems, renewable energy systems, intelligent energy distribution, and compact nuclear fusion.[1][7][8] Merger talks between Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta began in March 1994, with the companies announcing their $10 billion planned merger on August 30, 1994.[9][10] The headquarters for the combined companies would be at Martin Marietta headquarters in North Bethesda, Maryland.[11] The deal was finalized on March 15, 1995, when the two companies' shareholders approved the merger.[12] The segments of the two companies not retained by the new company formed the basis for L-3 Communications, a mid-size defense contractor in its own right. Lockheed Martin also later spun off the materials company Martin Marietta Materials.[citation needed] The company's executives received large bonuses directly from the government as a result of the merger. Norman R. Augustine, who was at the time CEO of Martin Marietta, received an $8.2 million bonus.[13] Both companies contributed important products to the new portfolio.[citation needed] Lockheed products included the Trident missile, P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft, U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance airplanes, F-117 Nighthawk, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor, C-130 Hercules, A-4AR Fightinghawk and the DSCS-3 satellite. Martin Marietta products included Titan rockets, Sandia National Laboratories (management contract acquired in 1993), Space Shuttle External Tank, Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers, the Transfer Orbit Stage (under subcontract to Orbital Sciences Corporation) and various satellite models.[citation needed] On April 22, 1996, Lockheed Martin completed the acquisition of Loral Corporation's defense electronics and system integration businesses for $9.1 billion, the deal having been announced in January. The remainder of Loral became Loral Space & Communications.[14] Lockheed Martin abandoned plans for an $8.3 billion merger with Northrop Grumman on July 16, 1998, due to government concerns over the potential strength of the new group; Lockheed/Northrop would have had control of 25% of the Department of Defense's procurement budget.[15] For the Mars Climate Orbiter, Lockheed Martin incorrectly provided NASA with software using measurements in US Customary force units when metric units were expected; this resulted in the loss of the Orbiter at a cost of $125 million.[16][17] The development of the spacecraft cost $193 million.[18][19] In addition to their military products, in the 1990s Lockheed Martin developed the texture mapping chip for the Sega Model 2 arcade system board and the entire graphics system for the Sega Model 3, which were used to power some of the most popular arcade games of the time.[20] In May 2001, Lockheed Martin sold Lockheed Martin Control Systems to BAE Systems.[21] On November 27, 2000, Lockheed completed the sale of its Aerospace Electronic Systems business to BAE Systems for $1.67 billion, a deal announced in July 2000. This group encompassed Sanders Associates, Fairchild Systems, and Lockheed Martin Space Electronics & Communications.[22][23] In 2001, Lockheed Martin won the contract to build the F-35 Lightning II; this was the largest fighter aircraft procurement project since the F-16, with an initial order of 3,000 aircraft. In 2001, Lockheed Martin settled a nine–year investigation conducted by NASA's Office of Inspector General with the assistance of the Defense Contract Audit Agency. The company paid the United States government $7.1 million based on allegations that its predecessor, Lockheed Engineering Science Corporation, submitted false lease costs claims to NASA.[24] On July 8, 2003, a Lockheed Martin plant in Meridian, Mississippi became the scene of a racially motivated mass shooting when an assembly line worker murdered six co-workers (five of whom were black) and wounded eight before killing himself.[25] In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Lockheed Martin's President refused to disclose whether company officials were previously aware of any red flags regarding the worker.[26] The company had launched its own investigation into the worker's behavior prior to the massacre following complaints from numerous black employees regarding incidents involving the worker. He had been ordered to attend anger management courses and diversity training but refused.[27] On May 12, 2006, The Washington Post reported that when Robert Stevens took control of Lockheed Martin in 2004, he faced the dilemma that within 10 years, 100,000 of the about 130,000 Lockheed Martin employees – more than three-quarters – would be retiring.[28] On August 31, 2006, Lockheed Martin won a $3.9 billion contract from NASA to design and build the CEV capsule, later named Orion for the Ares I rocket in the Constellation Program. In 2009, NASA reduced the capsule crew requirements from the initial six seats to four for transport to the International Space Station.[29] In August 2007, Lockheed Martin acquired 3Dsolve, a Cary, North Carolina, company that created simulations and training modules for the military and corporate clients.[30] Renamed Lockheed Martin 3D Learning Systems, the company remained in Cary with 3D's founder Richard Boyd as director.[31] The name was eventually shortened to Lockheed Martin 3D Solutions.[32] On August 13, 2008, Lockheed Martin acquired the government business unit of Nantero, Inc., a company that had developed methods and processes for incorporating carbon nanotubes in next-generation electronic devices.[33][34] In 2009, Lockheed Martin bought Unitech.[35] On November 18, 2010, Lockheed Martin announced that it would be closing its Eagan, Minnesota, location by 2013 to reduce costs and optimize capacity at its locations nationwide.[36] In January 2011, Lockheed Martin agreed to pay the U.S. Government $2 million to settle allegations that the company submitted false claims on a U.S. government contract for that amount. The allegations came from a contract with the Naval Oceanographic Office Major Shared Resource Center in Mississippi.[37] On May 25, 2011, Lockheed Martin bought the first Quantum Computing System from D-Wave Systems. Lockheed Martin and D-Wave will collaborate to realize the benefits of a computing platform based upon a quantum annealing processor, as applied to some of Lockheed Martin's most challenging computation problems. Lockheed Martin established a multi-year contract that includes one system, maintenance, and services.[38] On May 28, 2011, it was reported that a cyberattack using previously stolen EMC files had broken through to sensitive materials at the contractor.[39] It is unclear if the Lockheed incident is the specific prompt whereby on June 1, 2011, the new United States military strategy, makes explicit that a cyberattack is casus belli for a traditional act of war.[40] On March 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said that Lockheed Martin had agreed to settle allegations that the defense contractor had sold overpriced perishable tools used on many contracts. The DOJ said the allegations were based specifically on the subsidiary Tools & Metals Inc's inflation of costs between 1998 and 2005, which Lockheed Martin then passed on to the U.S. government under its contracts. Further, in March 2006, Todd B. Loftis, a former TMI president, was sentenced to 87 months in prison and ordered to pay a fine of $20 million following his guilty plea.[41] On July 10, 2012, Lockheed Martin announced it was cutting its workforce by 740 workers to reduce costs and remain competitive as necessary for future growth.[42] On November 27, 2012, Lockheed Martin announced that Marillyn Hewson would become the corporation's chief executive officer on January 1, 2013.[43] On January 7, 2013, Lockheed Martin Canada announced that it would be acquiring the engine maintenance, repair, and overhaul assets from Aveos Fleet Performance in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. On February 20, 2013, Lockheed Martin Corp complied with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, agreeing to pay a $19.5 million lawsuit to conclude a securities fraud class-action legal battle that had accused the company of deceiving shareholders in regards to expectations for the company's information technology division.[44] On July 3, 2013, Lockheed Martin announced that it was partnering with DreamHammer to use the company's software for integrated command and control of its unmanned aerial vehicles.[45] Lockheed Martin teamed up with Bell Helicopter to propose the V-280 Valor tiltrotor for the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program.[46] In September 2013, Lockheed Martin acquired the Scotland-based tech firm, Amor Group, saying the deal would aid its plans to expand internationally and into non-defense markets.[47] On November 14, 2013, Lockheed announced they would be closing their Akron, Ohio facility laying off 500 employees and transferring other employees to other locations.[48] In October 2013, Lockheed announced it expected to finalize a $2.2 billion contract with the United States Air Force for two advanced military communications satellites.[49] In March 2014, Lockheed Martin acquired Beontra AG, a provider of integrated planning and demand forecasting tools for airport, planning to expand their business in commercial airport information technology solutions.[50] Also, in March 2014, Lockheed Martin announced its acquisition of Industrial Defender Inc.[51] On June 2, 2014, Lockheed Martin received a Pentagon contract to build a space fence that would track debris, keeping it from damaging satellites and spacecraft.[52] On December 20, 2014, Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems agreed to settle a False Claims Act lawsuit paying $27.5 million to finalize allegations that it had knowingly overbilled taxpayers for work performed by company staff who did not hold the relevant essential qualifications for the contract.[53] On July 20, 2015, Lockheed Martin announced plans to purchase Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corporation at a cost of $7.1 billion.[54][55] The Pentagon has criticized the acquisition as causing a reduction in competition.[56] In November 2015, the acquisition received final approval from the Chinese government,[57] with a total cost of $9 billion.[58] Dan Schulz was named the president of Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky company.[59] Lockheed Martin has shown[when?] sketches for a twin-engine, blended wing body strategic airlifter similar in size to the C-5.[60] On March 31, 2015, the US Navy awarded Lockheed Martin a contract worth $362 million for the construction of Freedom-class ship LCS 21 and $79 million for advance procurement for LCS 23. The Freedom-class ships are built by Fincantieri Marinette Marine in Marinette, Wisconsin.[61] In December 2015, Lockheed won an $867 million seven-year contract to train Australia's next generation of military pilots. The deal also has the option to extend this contract across 26 years, which would greatly increase the deal's value.[62] In August 2016, Canadian Forces Maritime tested an integrated submarine combat system developed by Lockheed Martin. The test marked Canada's first use of the combat system with the MK 48 heavyweight torpedo, variant 7AT.[63] The same month, a deal to merge Leidos with the entirety of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business came to a close.[64][65] In May 2017, during a visit to Saudi Arabia by President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia signed business deals worth tens of billions of dollars with U.S. companies, including Lockheed Martin.[66] (See: 2017 United States–Saudi Arabia arms deal) On August 13, 2018, Lockheed Martin announced that the company had secured a $480 million contract from the United States Air Force to develop a hypersonic weapon prototype. A hypersonic missile can travel at one mile a second. This is the second contract for hypersonic weapons that Martin has secured; The first was from the Air Force as well and for $928 million which was announced in April 2018.[67][68] On November 29, 2018, Lockheed Martin was awarded a Commercial Lunar Payload Services contract by NASA, which makes it eligible to bid on delivering science and technology payloads to the Moon for NASA, worth $2.6 billion.[69] Lockheed Martin plans to formally propose a lander called McCandless Lunar Lander, named after the late astronaut and former Lockheed Martin employee Bruce McCandless II, who in 1984 performed the first free-flying spacewalk without a lifeline to the orbiting shuttle, using a jetpack built by the company.[70] This lander would be based on the successful design of the Phoenix and InSight Mars landers.[71] On April 11, 2019, at 6:35 pm EDT, an Arabsat-6A satellite was successfully launched from (LC-39A). This satellite is one of two, the other being SaudiGeoSat-1/HellasSat-4 and they are the \"most advanced commercial communications satellites ever built by\" Lockheed Martin.[72] On September 23, 2019, Lockheed Martin and NASA signed a $4.6-billion contract to build six or more Orion capsules for NASA's Artemis program to send astronauts to the Moon.[73] In January 2020, the Naval Sea Systems Command awarded Lockheed Martin with a $138 million contract related with the AEGIS Combat System Engineering Agent (CSEA). The LMT Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) unit of the company is to develop, integrate, test, and deliver the AEGIS Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 20 integrated combat system. Martin will work on the AEGIS in New Jersey. The project is expected to be completed by December 2020.[74] In January 2020, the Pentagon found at least 800 software defects in Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets owned by the US Armed Forces during an annual review. The 2018 and 2019 reviews revealed a large number of defects as well.[75] In February 2020, Lockheed Martin acquired Vector Launch Inc's satellite software technology GalacticSky for $4.25 million after a bankruptcy court received no bids by the February 21 deadline.[76][77] On March 16, 2020, Lockheed Martin announced that James D. Taiclet would replace Marillyn Hewson as CEO, effective June 15.[78] In January 2021, Taiclet became chairman of the company as well.[79] Lockheed Martin was sanctioned by the Chinese government in July 2020,[80] October 2020,[81] and February 2023 due to arm sales to Taiwan.[82] On December 20, 2020, it was announced that Lockheed Martin would acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings for $4.4 billion.[83] The acquisition was expected to close in first quarter of 2022.[84] On February 13, 2022, Lockheed abandoned the deal following regulatory disapproval.[85][86] In 2022, due to the Russo-Ukrainian war, major arms manufacturers, including Lockheed Martin,[87] reported a sharp increase in interim sales and profits.[88][89][90] In May 2023, Lockheed formed a new microelectronics subsidiary ForwardEdge ASIC to design custom application-specific integrated circuits for its customers.[91][92] In November 2023, attempts at Direct action were taken against arms companies in the US and the UK, including Lockheed Martin,[93][94] that supplied weapons to Israel during the Gaza war.[95] In March 2024, Lockheed Martin submitted a bid to acquire Terran Orbital.[96] On June 28, 2024, the U.S. Army awarded Lockheed Martin a $4.5 billion contract to supply Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles. The contract included 870 PAC-3 MSE missiles and related hardware. Lockheed was tasked with manufacturing the newest version of these interceptors, with each PAC-3 MSE missile costing approximately $4 million, as per Army budget documents.[97] On October 9, 2024, Lockheed Martin announced the appointment of Chauncey McIntosh as vice president and general manager of the F-35 Lightning II Program, effective December 1, 2024. He succeeded Bridget Lauderdale, who retired after 38 years with the company.[98] In December 2024, Lockheed Martin announced that it had formed a subsidiary, Astris AI, that would help U.S. defense companies to incorporate artificial intelligence into their operations.[99] For the fiscal year 2020, Lockheed Martin reported earnings of $6.833 billion, with an annual revenue of $65.398 billion, an increase of 9.3% over the previous year.[101] Backlog was 144.0 billion at the end of 2019, up from 130.5 billion at the end of the 2018. Firm orders were $94.5 billion at the end of 2019.[102] Its shares traded at over $389 per share.[103] Its market capitalization was valued at US$109.83 billion at the end of 2019.[104] Lockheed Martin ranked No. 60 in the 2019 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue (down from No. 59 in 2018).[105] Lockheed profits sharply dropped 80% in Q2 2025, owing to a highly classified U.S. government aerospace program CEO James Taiclet described as \"magical\".[129] The loss from development of the described \"game changing\" classified aerospace program totaled $1.6 billion.[130] Taiclet stated investors would be unable to know details of the \"magical\" classified aerospace program for many years to come.[129] During the same earnings call, Lockheed acknowledged the existence of a second highly classified aerospace program, described as well as both magical and game-changing.[130] The board of directors consists of 14 members. As of 2020, members include:[135] As of December 2023, Lockheed Martin shares are mainly held by institutional investors (State Street Corporation, Vanguard group, BlackRock, Capital Group Companies, and others).[137] Lockheed Martin is listed as the largest U.S. government contractor and ranks first for the number of incidents, and fifth for the size of settlements on the 'contractor misconduct' database maintained by the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington, D.C.–based watchdog group. Since 1995, the company has agreed to pay $676.8 million to settle 88 instances of misconduct.[138] In 2015, Lockheed Martin agreed to pay $4.7 million to settle charges that it illegally used taxpayer money to lobby the federal government to block competitors, including by funneling funds through its subsidiary, Sandia Corporation.[139][140] This involved hiring former Representative Heather Wilson, one of the most influential ex-lawmakers in the defense sector, as an unregistered lobbyist to maintain Lockheed's lucrative nuclear weapons lab contracts.[140][141] More broadly, commentators have criticized Lockheed Martin and other weapons defense firms for using secretive spending and dark money to influence defense policy, raising concerns about reduced accountability and national security risks.[142] In 2013, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan criticized the company's F-35 fighter program. The general said: \"I want them both to start behaving like they want to be around for 40 years ... I want them to take on some of the risk of this program. I want them to invest in cost reductions. I want them to do the things that will build a better relationship. I'm not getting all that love yet.\"[143] The criticism came in the wake of previous criticism from former Defense Secretary Robert Gates regarding the same program.[144] Lockheed Martin has highlighted the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine as potential opportunities for future revenue growth.[145] According to the magazine Politico, Lockheed Martin has \"a political network that is already the envy of its competitors\", and its contracts enjoy wide bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress thanks to it having \"perfected the strategy of spreading jobs on weapons programs in key states and congressional districts\".[146] The company's 2022 lobbying expenditure is $13.6 million (2009 total: $13.7 million).[147][148] Through its political action committee (PAC), the company provides low levels of financial support to candidates who advocate national defense and relevant business issues.[149] It was the largest contributor to the House Armed Services Committee chairman, Republican Buck McKeon of California with over $50,000 donated in the election cycle as of January 2011. It also was the top donor to Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-HI), the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee before his death in 2012.[4] Lockheed Martin Employees Political Action Committee is one of the 50 largest in the country, according to FEC data. With contributions from 3,000 employees, it donates $500,000 a year to about 260 House and Senate candidates.[150][needs update] In 2025, Lockheed Martin was one of the donors who funded the White House's East Wing demolition, and planned building of a ballroom.[151] Senior management consists of the CEO, CFO, and Executive Vice Presidents (EVPs) of four business areas.[152][153] The EVPs are responsible for managing major programs.[citation needed] On March 16, 2020, Lockheed announced that CEO Marillyn Hewson would become executive chair and be succeeded as CEO by James Taiclet on June 15; Taiclet was at the time the head of American Tower, and had previously been the president of Honeywell Aerospace and before that a VP at United Technologies. Lockheed also announced that it would create the chief operating officer role, to which current EVP Frank A. St John would be promoted.[154] Employees in each program are organized into four tiers: Tier 1: Program Manager/VP, Tier 2: Functional Teams (Finance, Chief Engineer, Quality, Operations, etc.), Tier 3: Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) (Weapon System Development, Weapon System Integration, etc.), and Tier 4: detailed product development. Floor or touch workers belong to component assembly teams.[155] Lockheed Martin manages and maintains its relationship with these touch workers through its supervisors and unions.[156] Lockheed Martin manages employees through its Full Spectrum Leadership and LM21 programs.[157] The LM21 program relies on Six Sigma principles, which are techniques to improve efficiency. Senior management constructs leadership councils and assigns managers to facilitate Kaizen events, which target specific processes for improvement. A manager facilitates teams and processes stakeholders and suppliers to streamline process implementation.[158][159][155] Tier 2 Functional Leads and Tier 3 IPT Leads report to Tier 1. IPT leads are responsible for entire systems or products defined by the contract's Statement of Work.[155] To control quality, Lockheed Martin trains and builds IPT teams.[155] and ensures that work is executed correctly through a Technical Performance Measure (TPM) system which emphasizes its Lean and 6 Sigma processes. Middle management uses commitment mechanisms that parallel high commitment and human relations theory.[160] Floor employees assemble aircraft using Flow-to-takt lean manufacturing process[161] which uses properties from both division of labor and scientific management. By separating tasks based on parts, Lockheed Martin utilizes the division of labor theory,[162] specialization on a specific area creates efficiency.[citation needed] The \"Double Helix methodology\" is a systems development methodology used by Lockheed Martin. It combines experimentation, technology, and a warfighter's concept of operations to create new tactics and weapons.[163]"}

Palmdale is home to the Advanced Development Programs (ADP), informally known as the \"Skunk Works\". Various subassemblies are produced at locations in Florida, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The company draws upon the history of the former Lockheed and Martin Marietta corporations. While the formation of Lockheed Martin in 1995 was a merger of equals, by far the greatest contribution to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics was the product portfolio of Lockheed. This included the C-5, C-130, and C-141 transports as well as the F-2, F-16 (purchased from General Dynamics), F-117, F-22, and F-35 Lightning II. The most important project by far to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics is the F-35 Lightning II (JSF). Worth a potential $200bn the initial order book is approximately 3,000 excluding almost guaranteed export orders. Lockheed also supports its F-22 air dominance fighter in USAF service.

MFC also has contracts with the U.S. Government for various classified programs.[2] MFC has approximately 15,500 employees.[3] It is based in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie, Texas. Major LM MFC facilities are located in Orlando, Florida; Grand Prairie, Texas; Archbald, Pennsylvania; Chelmsford, Massachusetts; East Camden, Arkansas; Horizon City, Texas; Lufkin, Texas; Ocala, Florida; Santa Barbara, California; Troy, Alabama, and Ampthill, Bedfordshire (a part of Lockheed Martin UK). MFC made $1.4 billion in operating profit on sales of $10.1 billion in 2019. This was out of total Lockheed Martin profits of $6.6 billion on sales of $59.8 billion. Lockheed Martin projects MFC's 2020 profits will be $1.5 billion on sales of $11.0-11.3 billion.[4] For context, based on 2019 sales, this would put MFC at No. 314 on the 2019 Fortune 500 were it a stand-alone corporation.[5] MFC became a Lockheed Martin business area on December 31, 2012, when the Lockheed Martin Electronic Systems business area was split into two new business areas: MFC and Mission Systems and Training (MST was later renamed Rotary and Mission Systems with the acquisition of Sikorsky). Prior to that, MFC was a business unit operating within the Electronic Systems business area.[6] In 2012, the MFC business unit was a recipient of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. The Grand Prairie facility dates back to being a major component of the now defunct LTV Corporation, as LTV Aerospace and Defense with \"Vought\" Division names, and later became part of Loral as Loral Vought Systems, before Loral's merger with Lockheed Martin. On May 22, 2024, the unit was sanctioned by the Chinese government due to arms sales to Taiwan.[7] Major programs include: the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) air and missile defense programs; the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Hellfire, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and Javelin tactical missile programs; the Apache, SNIPER and Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) fire control systems programs; and the Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) program.[8] Primary MFC customers include the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and U.S. allies. MFC also has customers in the global civil nuclear power industry.[9] One of Missiles and Fire Control's most lucrative program is the TADS/PNVS (Target Acquisition Designation Sight, Pilot Night Vision System) program for the AH-64 Apache helicopter. The second generation M-TADS (also known as Arrowhead) is now being fielded to United States Army and foreign customers.[10] The company also is a major supplier of Electro-Optic systems to the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), officially known as the F-35 Lightning II. The company has a long history from the Vought years (later half of the 20th century) of being the number-one supplier of missiles and advanced weapon systems to the US Army, which continues to this day."}

The division employs about 20,000 people, and its products include commercial and military satellites, space probes, missile defense systems, NASA's Orion spacecraft, and the Space Shuttle external tank.[1] The Lockheed Missile Systems Division was established in Van Nuys, California, in late 1953 to consolidate work on the Lockheed X-17 and X-7. The X-17 was a three-stage solid-fuel research rocket designed to test the effects of high mach atmospheric reentry. The X-17 was also used as the booster for the Operation Argus series of three high-altitude nuclear tests conducted in the South Atlantic in 1958. The Lockheed X-7 (dubbed the \"Flying Stove Pipe\") was an American uncrewed test bed of the 1950s for ramjet engines and missile guidance technology. Lockheed Missiles Division moved from Van Nuys, California, to the newly constructed facility in Palo Alto, California, in 1956, then to the larger facility in Sunnyvale in 1957. The Polaris missile was the first major new program for both locations, followed later by satellite programs, thus the name change to Lockheed Missiles and Space Division. The UGM-27 Polaris was a Submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) built during the Cold War by Lockheed Missiles & Space Division in Sunnyvale, California, for the United States Navy. The Polaris program started development in 1956, with its first flight test in 1958. In 1962, the USS Ethan Allen (SSBN-608) successfully fired a Polaris A-1 missile against a test target in 1960. The SLBM has evolved through Polaris (A2), Polaris (A3), Poseidon (C3), Trident I (C4) and ongoing with the Trident II (D5). All of these were designed and managed at the Sunnyvale facility. Together, these are known as the Navy's Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) Program. Lockheed Martin has been the sole provider of FBM missiles since 1956. Lockheed Missiles & Space became prime contractor for elements of Military Satellite System (WS 117L), calling for the development of a strategic satellite system. The core element was Lockheed's Agena spacecraft, the world's first multipurpose spacecraft with boost and maneuvering engines, also acting as the 2nd stage of the launch vehicle and/or carrier vehicle for the reconnaissance system. WS-117L and Agena lead to the development of the Corona (satellite)—the nation's first photo reconnaissance satellite system, collecting both intelligence and mapping imagery from August 1960 until May 1972. Over 800,000 images were taken from space, with imaging resolution originally equaling 8 metres (26 ft 3 in), later improved to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in). The program was declassified in February 1995. Approximately 365 Agena spacecraft supported a wide variety of missions, from NASA's early interplanetary efforts; to the US Navy's SeaSat, the USAF's Corona, Midas and Samos series between January 1959 and February 1987, when the last Agena D was launched. The Corona program led to the development of the KH-7 Gambit and KH-9 Hexagon programs. The first Gambit system, launched in 1963, was equipped with a 77 in (2,000 mm) focal length camera system. The second system, KH-8 Gambit 3, was equipped with the camera system that included a 175 in (4,400 mm) focal length camera. The system was first launched in 1966 and provided the U.S. with exquisite surveillance capabilities from space for nearly two decades. Hexagon was first launched in 1971 to improve upon Corona's capability to image broad denied areas for threats to the United States. Twelve of the 19 systems flown also carried a mapping camera to aid in U.S. military war planning. In addition, Gambit and Hexagon were launched aboard rockets built by Lockheed Martin heritage companies. Gambit 1 was launched on an Atlas launch vehicle with the orbiting Agena D upper stage and Gambit 3 was launched using a Titan IIIB booster. Hexagon was launched aboard the larger Titan IIID launch vehicle. Lockheed achieved the first hit-to-kill of an Intercontinental ballistic missile ICBM reentry vehicle in 1984 with the Homing Overlay Experiment, using the Kinetic Kill Vehicle (KKV) force of impact alone to destroy a mock warhead outside the Earth's atmosphere. The KKV was equipped with an infrared seeker, guidance electronics and a propulsion system. Once in space, the KKV could extend a folded structure similar to an umbrella skeleton of 4 m (13 ft) diameter to enhance its effective cross section. This device would destroy the Minuteman RV with a closing speed of about 20,000 ft/s (6,100 m/s) at an altitude of more than 100 mi (160 km). Further testing produced the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Weapon System, the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) and the Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV). The Titan I was the first version of the Titan family of rockets, developed in October 1955, when the U.S. Air Force awarded the then Martin Company in Denver, Colorado, a contract to build an Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). It was the United States' first two-stage rocket and formed an integral part of their strategic deterrent force. In the early 1960s, the rocket was adapted to launch the Gemini capsule that carried two people at a time into space. Titan II succeeded in launching 12 Gemini spacecraft and has also helped to launch the Viking missions to Mars, Voyager 1 and 2 and most recently Cassini–Huygens to Saturn. It began as a backup ICBM project in case the Atlas was delayed. It was a two-stage rocket powered by RP-1 and LOX. The Titan I and Atlas ICBMs using RP-1/LOX fuel did not have a quick launch sequence. They took about 30 minutes to fuel up and fire. Most Titan rockets were derivatives of the Titan II ICBM. The Titan II ICBM had one W-53 warhead with a 9 megaton yield, making it the most powerful ICBM on-standby in the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The Titan III was a modified Titan II with optional solid rocket boosters. It was developed by the U.S. Air Force as a heavy-lift satellite launcher to be used mainly to launch U.S. Military payloads such as Defense Support Program (DSP) early-warning, intelligence (spy), and defense communications satellites. The Titan IV is a stretched Titan III with non-optional solid rocket boosters. It could be launched either with the Centaur upper stage, with the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) or without any upper stage. It was almost exclusively used to launch U.S. military payloads, though it was also used to launch NASA's Cassini–Huygens probe to Saturn in 1997.[2] On 8 February 2020, Lockheed announced it selected Los Angeles-based rocket-builder ABL Space to launch a mission from Scotland in two years, which the companies expect to be the first from the U.K. and first from European soil.[3]   RCA Astro-Electronics Division, a division of RCA. In March 1958, RCA established Astro Electronics Products (AEP) as a division of RCA Defense Electronic Products. This spacecraft design and manufacturing facility, also referred to as the RCA Space Center was located in East Windsor, New Jersey. On 18 December 1958, RCA Astro successfully launched its first communications satellite from Cape Canaveral. It was called SCORE, (Signal Communications by Orbiting Relay Equipment). SCORE brought the world's first voice message from space.[4][5] RCA Astro went on to become one of the leading American manufacturers of satellites and other space systems, including the world's first weather satellite, TIROS, launched in 1960. In 1985, two members of the Astro Electronics engineering staff, Bob Cenker[6] and Gerard E. Magilton,[7] were selected to train as NASA Payload Specialists for the Space Shuttle Columbia mission designated as STS-61-C. The primary goal of the flight was to deliver a communications satellite, RCA Americom Satcom KU-1,[8] designed and built at the Astro-Electronics facility, into orbit. Cenker was selected as a member of the flight crew, and Magilton was assigned as the back-up. When Columbia launched on 12 January 1986, Bob Cenker became RCA Astro-Electronic's first astronaut.[9][10][11][12] Following the destruction of Space Shuttle Challenger with the next Shuttle mission,[13] civilian Payload Specialists were excluded from flying Shuttle missions until 1990.[14] By that time, RCA had been purchased by General Electric, and RCA Astro-Electronics became part of GE.[15][16] As a result, Cenker was the only RCA Astro-Electronics employee, and only employee in the history of the facility under all of its subsequent names, to ever fly in space. The facility operated as GE Astro Space until it was sold to Martin Marietta in 1993.[15] Then in 1995 it became part of the newly named Lockheed Martin following the Martin Marietta merger with the Lockheed.[15] Soon after the merger, Lockheed Martin announced that the New Jersey facility would be closed. The New Jersey facility completed work on the in-process projects over the next few years, including the development of the Inmarsat 3 Series Spacecraft. Inmarsat used the latest spot-beam technology and higher power to supply voice and data communications services worldwide to mobile terminals as small as pocket-size messaging units on ships, aircraft and vehicles. As the facility competed its backlog of ongoing commercial and government space projects some of the work was also transferred to other Lockheed Martin facilities, including the heritage-Lockheed facility in Sunnyvale, California, and a newly built facility in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The facility that began as RCA Astro Electronics closed for good in 1998.[15][16] Lockheed Martin Space Systems is headquartered in Denver, but still does considerable operations from Sunnyvale. Also located near Sunnyvale is the main office of Lockheed Martin's space research and development group, the Advanced Technology Center (ATC), formerly the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory (LPARL).[citation needed] On 31 August 2006, NASA selected Lockheed Martin Corp., based in Bethesda, Maryland, as the prime contractor to design, develop, and build Orion, U.S.-European spacecraft for a new generation of explorers. As of 21 May 2011, the Orion spacecraft was being developed for crewed missions to Moon and then Mars. It will be launched by the Space Launch System.[citation needed] In November 2010, Lockheed Martin Space Systems was selected by NASA for consideration for potential contract awards for heavy lift launch vehicle system concepts, and propulsion technologies.[citation needed] In June 2014, the company was contracted by the United States Air Force on a fixed-price basis to build the fifth and sixth Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, known as GEO-5 and GEO-6, for the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) at a cost of US$1.86 billion.[citation needed] In June 2015, Lockheed Martin announced plans to expand its workforce at Cape Canaveral, Florida, in order to support the U.S. Navy's Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile program.[17] Lockheed Martin Space comprises five Lines of Business (LOBs).

A multirole combat aircraft designed for both air superiority and strike missions, it also has electronic warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. Lockheed Martin is the prime F-35 contractor with principal partners Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems. The aircraft has three main variants: the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) F-35A, the short take-off and vertical-landing (STOVL) F-35B, and the carrier variant (CV) catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) F-35C. The aircraft descends from the Lockheed Martin X-35, which in 2001 beat the Boeing X-32 to win the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program intended to replace the F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Hornet, and the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II \"jump jet\", among others. Its development is primarily funded by the United States, with additional funding from program partner countries from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and close U.S. allies, including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom, and formerly Turkey.[5][6][7] Outside of NATO, Switzerland and Singapore have placed orders for the aircraft, with other countries considering purchases. The program has drawn criticism for its unprecedented size, complexity, ballooning costs, and delayed deliveries.[8][N 1] The decision to start manufacturing the aircraft while it was still in development and testing led to expensive design changes and retrofits.[10][11] As of July 2024[update], the average unit costs (excluding the engine) are: US$82.5 million for the F-35A, $109 million for the F-35B, and $102.1 million for the F-35C.[12] The F135 engine costs $20.4 million as of August 2025.[13] The F-35 first flew in 2006; its variants entered U.S. service in July 2015 (Marine Corps F-35B), August 2016 (Air Force F-35A), and February 2019 (Navy F-35C).[2][3][4] The aircraft first saw combat in 2018, during Israeli Air Force attacks on Syria.[14] The F-35 has since been used in combat by the U.S. in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, and Venezuela; by Israel in Gaza, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen; and by the UK in Iraq and Syria. F-35As contribute to US nuclear forward deployment in European NATO countries. The U.S. plans to buy 2,456 F-35s through 2044, which will represent the bulk of its crewed fixed-wing tactical aviation for several decades; the aircraft is to be a cornerstone of NATO and U.S.-allied air power and operate until 2070.[15][16][17] The F-35 was the product of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, which was the merger of various combat aircraft programs from the 1980s and 1990s. One progenitor program was the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Short Take-Off/Vertical Landing (ASTOVL) which ran from 1983 to 1994; ASTOVL aimed to develop a Harrier jump jet replacement for the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) and the UK Royal Navy. Under one of ASTOVL's classified programs, the Supersonic STOVL Fighter (SSF), Lockheed's Skunk Works conducted research for a stealthy supersonic STOVL fighter intended for both U.S. Air Force (USAF) and USMC; among key STOVL technologies explored was the shaft-driven lift fan (SDLF) system. Lockheed's concept was a single-engine canard delta aircraft weighing about 24,000 lb (11,000 kg) empty. ASTOVL was rechristened as the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter (CALF) in 1993 and involved Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and Boeing.[18][19] The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused considerable reductions in Department of Defense (DoD) spending and subsequent restructuring. In 1993, the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program emerged following the cancellation of the USAF's Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) and U.S. Navy's (USN) Advanced Attack/Fighter (A/F-X) programs. MRF, a program for a relatively affordable F-16 Fighting Falcon replacement, was scaled back and delayed due to post–Cold War defense posture easing F-16 fleet usage and thus extending its service life as well as increasing budget pressure from the Lockheed Martin F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program. The A/F-X, initially known as the Advanced-Attack (A-X), began in 1991 as the USN's follow-on to the Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program for an Grumman A-6 Intruder replacement; the ATA's resulting McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II had been canceled due to technical problems and cost overruns in 1991. In the same year, the termination of the Naval Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), a naval development of USAF's ATF program to replace the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, resulted in additional fighter capability being added to A-X, which was then renamed A/F-X. Amid increased budget pressure, the DoD's Bottom-Up Review (BUR) in September 1993 announced MRF's and A/F-X's cancellations, with applicable experience brought to the emerging JAST program.[19] JAST was not meant to develop a new aircraft, but rather to develop requirements, mature technologies, and demonstrate concepts for advanced strike warfare.[20] As JAST progressed, the need for concept demonstrator aircraft by 1996 emerged, which would coincide with the full-scale flight demonstrator phase of ASTOVL/CALF. Because the ASTOVL/CALF concept appeared to align with the JAST charter, the two programs were eventually merged in 1994 under the JAST name, with the program now serving the USAF, USMC, and USN.[20] JAST was subsequently renamed to Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) in 1995, with STOVL submissions by McDonnell Douglas, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin,[N 2] and Boeing. The JSF was expected to eventually replace large numbers of multi-role and strike fighters in the inventories of the US and its allies, including the Harrier, F-16, F/A-18, Fairchild A-10 Thunderbolt II, and Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk.[21] International participation is a key aspect of the JSF program, starting with United Kingdom participation in the ASTOVL program. Many international partners requiring modernization of their air forces were interested in the JSF. The United Kingdom joined JAST/JSF as a founding member in 1995 and thus became the only Tier 1 partner of the JSF program;[22] Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Canada, Australia, and Turkey joined the program during the Concept Demonstration Phase (CDP), with Italy and the Netherlands being Tier 2 partners and the rest Tier 3. Consequently, the aircraft was developed in cooperation with international partners and available for export.[23] Boeing and Lockheed Martin were selected in early 1997 for CDP, with their concept demonstrator aircraft designated X-32 and X-35 respectively; the McDonnell Douglas team was eliminated and Northrop Grumman and British Aerospace joined the Lockheed Martin team. Each firm would produce two prototype air vehicles to demonstrate conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL), carrier takeoff and landing (CV), and STOVL.[N 3] Lockheed Martin's design would make use of the work on the SDLF system conducted under the ASTOVL/CALF program. The key aspect of the X-35 that enabled STOVL operation, the SDLF system consists of the lift fan in the forward center fuselage that could be activated by engaging a clutch that connects the driveshaft to the turbines and thus augmenting the thrust from the engine's swivel nozzle. Research from prior aircraft incorporating similar systems, such as the Convair Model 200,[N 4] Rockwell XFV-12, and Yakovlev Yak-141, were also taken into consideration.[25][26][27] By contrast, Boeing's X-32 employed a direct lift system that the augmented turbofan would be reconfigured to when engaging in STOVL operation. Lockheed Martin's commonality strategy was to replace the STOVL variant's SDLF with a fuel tank and the aft swivel nozzle with a two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzle for the CTOL variant.[N 5] STOVL operation is made possible through a patented shaft-driven LiftFan propulsion system.[28] This would enable identical aerodynamic configuration for the STOVL and CTOL variants, while the CV variant would have an enlarged wing to reduce landing speed for carrier recovery. Due to aerodynamic characteristics and carrier recovery requirements from the JAST merger, the design configuration settled on a conventional tail compared to the canard delta design from the ASTOVL/CALF; notably, the conventional tail configuration offers much lower risk for carrier recovery compared to the ASTOVL/CALF canard configuration, which was designed without carrier compatibility in mind. This enabled greater commonality between all three variants, as the commonality goal was important at this design stage.[29] Lockheed Martin's prototypes would consist of the X-35A for demonstrating CTOL before converting it to the X-35B for STOVL demonstration and the larger-winged X-35C for CV compatibility demonstration.[30] The X-35A first flew on 24 October 2000 and conducted flight tests for subsonic and supersonic flying qualities, handling, range, and maneuver performance.[31] After 28 flights, the aircraft was then converted into the X-35B for STOVL testing, with key changes including the addition of the SDLF, the three-bearing swivel module (3BSM), and roll-control ducts. The X-35B would successfully demonstrate the SDLF system by performing stable hover, vertical landing, and short takeoff in less than 500 ft (150 m).[29][32] The X-35C first flew on 16 December 2000 and conducted field landing carrier practice tests.[31] On 26 October 2001, Lockheed Martin was declared the winner and was awarded the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract; Pratt & Whitney was separately awarded a development contract for the F135 engine for the JSF.[33] The F-35 designation, which was out of sequence with standard DoD numbering, was allegedly determined on the spot by program manager Major General Mike Hough; this came as a surprise even to Lockheed Martin, which had expected the F-24 designation for the JSF.[34] As the JSF program moved into the System Development and Demonstration phase, the X-35 demonstrator design was modified to create the F-35 combat aircraft. The forward fuselage was lengthened by 5 inches (13 cm) to make room for mission avionics, while the horizontal stabilizers were moved 2 inches (5.1 cm) aft to retain balance and control. The diverterless supersonic inlet changed from a four-sided to a three-sided cowl shape and was moved 30 inches (76 cm) aft. The fuselage section was fuller, the top surface raised by 1 inch (2.5 cm) along the centerline and the lower surface bulged to accommodate weapons bays. Following the designation of the X-35 prototypes, the three variants were designated F-35A (CTOL), F-35B (STOVL), and F-35C (CV), all with a design service life of 8,000 hours. Prime contractor Lockheed Martin performs overall systems integration and final assembly and checkout (FACO) at Air Force Plant 4 in Fort Worth, Texas,[N 6] while Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems supply components for mission systems and airframe.[35][36] Adding the systems of a fighter aircraft added weight. The F-35B gained the most, largely due to a 2003 decision to enlarge the weapons bays for commonality between variants; the total weight growth was reportedly up to 2,200 pounds (1,000 kg), over 8%, causing all STOVL key performance parameter (KPP) thresholds to be missed.[37] In December 2003, the STOVL Weight Attack Team (SWAT) was formed to reduce the weight increase; changes included thinned airframe members, smaller weapons bays and vertical stabilizers, less thrust fed to the roll-post outlets, and redesigning the wing-mate joint, electrical elements, and the airframe immediately aft of the cockpit. The inlet was also revised to accommodate more powerful, greater mass flow engines.[38][39] Many changes from the SWAT effort were applied to all three variants for commonality. By September 2004, these efforts had reduced the F-35B's weight by over 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg), while the F-35A and F-35C were reduced in weight by 2,400 pounds (1,100 kg) and 1,900 pounds (860 kg) respectively.[29][40] The weight reduction work cost $6.2 billion and caused an 18-month delay.[41] The first F-35A, designated AA-1, was rolled out at Fort Worth on 19 February 2006 and first flew on 15 December 2006 with chief test pilot Jon S. Beesley at the controls.[N 7][42] In 2006, the F-35 was given the name \"Lightning II\" after the Lockheed P-38 Lightning of World War II.[43] Some USAF pilots have nicknamed the aircraft \"Panther\" instead, and other nicknames include \"Fat Amy\" and \"Battle Penguin\".[44][45][46] The aircraft's software was developed as six releases, or Blocks, for SDD. The first two Blocks, 1A and 1B, readied the F-35 for initial pilot training and multi-level security. Block 2A improved the training capabilities, while 2B was the first combat-ready release planned for the USMC's Initial Operating Capability (IOC). Block 3i retains the capabilities of 2B while having new Technology Refresh 2 (TR-2) hardware and was planned for the USAF's IOC. The final release for SDD, Block 3F, would have full flight envelope and all baseline combat capabilities. Alongside software releases, each block also incorporates avionics hardware updates and air vehicle improvements from flight and structural testing.[47] In what is known as \"concurrency\", some low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft lots would be delivered in early Block configurations and eventually upgraded to Block 3F once development is complete.[48] After 17,000 flight test hours, the final flight for the SDD phase was completed in April 2018.[49] Like the F-22, the F-35 has been targeted by cyberattacks and technology theft efforts, as well as potential vulnerabilities in the integrity of the supply chain.[50][51][52] Testing found several major problems: early F-35B airframes were vulnerable to premature cracking,[N 8] the F-35C arrestor hook design was unreliable, fuel tanks were too vulnerable to lightning strikes, the helmet display had problems, and more. Software was repeatedly delayed due to its unprecedented scope and complexity. In 2009, the DoD Joint Estimate Team (JET) estimated that the program was 30 months behind the public schedule.[53][54] In 2011, the program was \"re-baselined\"; that is, its cost and schedule goals were changed, pushing the IOC from the planned 2010 to July 2015.[55][56] The decision to simultaneously test, fix defects, and begin production was criticized as inefficient; in 2014, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Frank Kendall called it \"acquisition malpractice\".[57] The three variants shared just 25% of their parts, far below the anticipated commonality of 70%.[58] The program received considerable criticism for cost overruns and for the total projected lifetime cost, as well as quality management shortcomings by contractors.[59][60] As of August 2023[update], the program was 80% over budget and 10 years late.[61] The JSF program was expected to cost about $200 billion for acquisition in base-year 2002 dollars when SDD was awarded in 2001.[62][63] As early as 2005, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) had identified major program risks in cost and schedule.[64] The costly delays strained the relationship between the Pentagon and contractors.[65] By 2017, delays and cost overruns had pushed the F-35 program's expected acquisition costs to $406.5 billion, with total lifetime cost (i.e., to 2070) to $1.5 trillion in then-year dollars which also includes operations and maintenance.[66][67][68] The F-35A's unit cost (not including engine) for LRIP Lot 13 was $79.2 million in base-year 2012 dollars.[69] Delays in development and operational test and evaluation, including integration into the Joint Simulation Environment, pushed full-rate production decision from the end of 2019 to March 2024, although actual production rate had already approached the full rate by 2020; the combined full rate at the Fort Worth, Italy, and Japan FACO plants is 156 aircraft annually.[70][71] The F-35 is expected to be continually upgraded over its lifetime. The first combat-capable Block 2B configuration, which had basic air-to-air and strike capabilities, was declared ready by the USMC in July 2015.[2] The Block 3F configuration began operational test and evaluation (OT&E) in December 2018 and its completion in late 2023 concluded SDD in March 2024.[72] The F-35 program is also conducting sustainment and upgrade development, with early aircraft from LRIP lot 2 onwards gradually upgraded to the baseline Block 3F standard by 2021.[73][needs update] With Block 3F as the final build for SDD, the first major upgrade program is Block 4 which began development in 2019 and was initially captured under the Continuous Capability Development and Delivery (C2D2) program. Block 4 is expected to enter service in incremental steps from the late 2020s to early 2030s and integrates additional weapons, including those unique to international customers, improved sensor capabilities including the new AN/APG-85 AESA radar and additional ESM bandwidth, and adds Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) support.[74][75] C2D2 also places greater emphasis on agile software development to enable quicker releases.[76] The key enabler of Block 4 is Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) avionics hardware, which consists of new display, core processor, and memory modules to support increased processing requirements, as well as engine upgrade that increases the amount of cooling available to support the additional mission systems. The engine upgrade effort explored both improvements to the F135 as well as significantly more power and efficient adaptive cycle engines. In 2018, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney were awarded contracts to develop adaptive cycle engines for potential application in the F-35,[N 9] and in 2022, the F-35 Adaptive Engine Replacement program was launched to integrate them.[77][78] However, in 2023 the USAF chose an improved F135 under the Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) program over an adaptive cycle engine due to cost as well as concerns over risk of integrating the new engine, initially designed for the F-35A, on the B and C.[79] Difficulties with the new TR-3 hardware, including regression testing, have caused delays to Block 4 as well as a halt in aircraft deliveries from July 2023 to July 2024.[80][81] In 2023, the GAO raised concerns in two reports that the estimated cost of the Block 4 upgrade has increased from $10.6 billion to $16.5 billion and completion of the upgrade is delayed from 2026 to 2029 the earliest.[82] In September 2025, it was announced that the Block 4 upgrade would be truncated and delayed due to technological uncertainties and engine upgrade delays, among other reasons. Critical changes that do not require an upgraded engine will remain in Block 4 and be ready by 2031 at the earliest. Upgrades that where originally planned for Block 4, but require the upgraded engine, or lack technological maturity, will be deferred to currently undefined efforts expected in the mid 2030s. Block 4 was originally intended to be completed in 2026.[83][84] Defense contractors have offered upgrades to the F-35 outside of official program contracts. In 2013, Northrop Grumman disclosed its development of a directional infrared countermeasures suite, named Threat Nullification Defensive Resource (ThNDR). The countermeasure system would share the same space as the Distributed Aperture System (DAS) sensors and acts as a laser missile jammer to protect against infrared-homing missiles.[85] Israel operates a unique subvariant of the F-35A, designated the F-35I, that is designed to better interface with and incorporate Israeli equipment and weapons. The Israeli Air Force also has their own F-35I test aircraft that provides more access to the core avionics to include their own equipment.[86] The United States is the primary customer and financial backer, with planned procurement of 1,763 F-35As for the USAF, 353 F-35Bs and 67 F-35Cs for the USMC, and 273 F-35Cs for the USN.[15] Additionally, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Australia, Norway, Denmark and Canada have agreed to contribute US$4.375 billion towards development costs, with the United Kingdom contributing about 10% of the planned development costs as the sole Tier 1 partner.[22] Britain supplies ejector seats, rear fuselage, active interceptor systems, targeting lasers and weapon release cables, mainly through British Aerospace, amounting to 15% of the value of the F-35, and is the largest supplier of spare parts for the jet after the US.[87] The initial plan was that the U.S. and eight major partner countries would acquire over 3,100 F-35s through 2035.[88] The three tiers of international participation generally reflect financial stake in the program, the amount of technology transfer and subcontracts open for bid by national companies, and the order in which countries can obtain production aircraft.[89] Alongside program partner countries, Israel and Singapore have joined as Security Cooperative Participants (SCP).[90][91][92] Sales to SCP and non-partner states, including Belgium, Japan, and South Korea, are made through the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales program.[7][93] Turkey was removed from the F-35 program in July 2019 over security concerns following its purchase of a Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system.[94][95][N 10] As of July 2024[update], the average flyaway costs per plane are: $82.5 million for the F-35A, $109 million for the F-35B, and $102.1 million for the F-35C.[12] The cost of the F-35 does not include the cost of the engine as this is negotiated in a separate contract, and engines are delivered free of charge to Lockheed Martin. The cost of the engine is $20.4 million in lot 18.[97] Lockheed Martin delivered a record 191 F-35 Lightning II fighter jets in 2025, bringing the global fleet to approximately 1,300 aircraft.[98] The F-35 is a family of single-engine, supersonic, stealth multirole strike fighters.[99] The second fifth-generation fighter to enter US service and the first operational supersonic STOVL stealth fighter, the F-35 emphasizes low observables, advanced avionics and sensor fusion that enable a high level of situational awareness and long range lethality;[100][101][102] the USAF considers the aircraft its primary strike fighter for conducting suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) and air interdiction missions, owing to the advanced sensors and mission systems.[103] The F-35 has a wing-tail configuration with two vertical stabilizers canted for stealth. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons,[N 11] rudders, and all-moving horizontal tails (stabilators); leading edge root extensions or chines[104] also run forwards to the inlets. The relatively short 35-foot wingspan of the F-35A and F-35B is set by the requirement to fit inside USN amphibious assault ship parking areas and elevators; the F-35C's larger wing is more fuel efficient.[105][106] The fixed diverterless supersonic inlets (DSI) use a bumped compression surface and forward-swept cowl to shed the boundary layer of the forebody away from the inlets, which form a Y-duct for the engine.[107] Structurally, the F-35 drew upon lessons from the F-22; composites comprise 35% of airframe weight, with the majority being bismaleimide and composite epoxy materials as well as some carbon nanotube-reinforced epoxy in later production lots.[108][109][110] The F-35 is considerably heavier than the lightweight fighters it replaces, with the lightest variant having an empty weight of 29,300 lb (13,300 kg); much of the weight can be attributed to the internal weapons bays and the extensive avionics carried.[111] Each F-35 contains about 50 pounds (23 kg) of samarium magnets.[112] While lacking the kinematic performance of the larger twin-engine F-22, the F-35 is competitive with fourth-generation fighters such as the F-16 and F/A-18, especially when they carry weapons because the F-35's internal weapons bay eliminates drag from external stores.[113] All variants have a top speed of Mach 1.6 (1,220 mph; 1,960 km/h), attainable with full internal payload. The Pratt & Whitney F135 engine gives good subsonic acceleration and energy, with supersonic dash in afterburner. The F-35, while not a \"supercruising\" aircraft, can fly at Mach 1.2 (913 mph; 1,470 km/h) for a dash of 150 miles (240 km) with afterburners. This ability can be useful in battlefield situations.[114] The large stabilitors, leading edge extensions and flaps, and canted rudders provide excellent high alpha (angle-of-attack) characteristics, with a trimmed alpha of 50°. Relaxed stability and triplex-redundant fly-by-wire controls provide excellent handling qualities and departure resistance.[115][116] Having over double the F-16's internal fuel, the F-35 has a considerably greater combat radius, while stealth also enables a more efficient mission flight profile.[117] The F-35's mission systems are among the most complex aspects of the aircraft. The avionics and sensor fusion are designed to improve the pilot's situational awareness and command-and-control capabilities and facilitate network-centric warfare.[99][118] Key sensors include the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, BAE Systems AN/ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare system, Northrop Grumman/Raytheon AN/AAQ-37 Electro-optical Distributed Aperture System (DAS), Lockheed Martin AN/AAQ-40 Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) and Northrop Grumman AN/ASQ-242 Communications, Navigation, and Identification (CNI) suite. The F-35 was designed for its sensors to work together to provide a cohesive image of the local battlespace; for example, the APG-81 radar also acts as a part of the electronic warfare system.[119] Much of the F-35's software was developed in C and C++ programming languages, while Ada83 code from the F-22 was also used; the Block 3F software has 8.6 million lines of code.[120][121] The Green Hills Software Integrity DO-178B real-time operating system (RTOS) runs on integrated core processors (ICPs); data networking includes the IEEE 1394b and Fibre Channel buses.[122][123] The avionics use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components when practical to make upgrades cheaper and more flexible; for example, to enable fleet software upgrades for the software-defined radio (SDR) systems.[124][125][126] The mission systems software, particularly for sensor fusion, was one of the program's most difficult parts and responsible for substantial program delays.[N 12][128][129] The APG-81 radar uses electronic scanning for rapid beam agility and incorporates passive and active air-to-air modes, strike modes, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) capability, with multiple target track-while-scan at ranges in excess of 80 nmi (150 km). The antenna is tilted backwards for stealth.[130] Complementing the radar is the AAQ-37 DAS: six infrared sensors that can track targets and warn of approaching missiles all around the aircraft; it acts as a situational-awareness infrared search and track (SAIRST) and feeds spherical infrared and night-vision imagery to the helmet visor.[131] The ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare system has ten radio frequency antennas embedded into the edges of the wing and tail for all-aspect radar warning receiver (RWR). It also provides sensor fusion of radio frequency and infrared tracking functions, geolocation threat targeting, and multispectral image countermeasures for self-defense against missiles. The electronic warfare system can detect and jam hostile radars.[132] The AAQ-40 EOTS is mounted behind a faceted low-observable window under the nose and performs laser targeting, forward-looking infrared (FLIR), and long range IRST functions.[133] The ASQ-242 CNI suite uses a half dozen physical links, including the directional Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL), for covert CNI functions.[134][135] Information from radio frequency receivers and infrared sensors are combined to form a single tactical picture for the pilot. The all-aspect target direction and identification can be shared via MADL to other platforms without compromising low observability, while Link 16 enables communication with older systems.[136] The F-35 was designed to accept upgrades to its processors, sensors, and software. Technology Refresh 3, which includes a new core processor and a new cockpit display, is planned for Lot 15 aircraft.[137] Lockheed Martin has offered the Advanced EOTS for the Block 4 configuration; the improved sensor fits into the same area as the baseline EOTS with minimal changes.[138] In June 2018, Lockheed Martin picked Raytheon for improved DAS.[139] The USAF has studied the potential for the F-35 to orchestrate attacks by unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) via its sensors and communications equipment.[140] A new radar called the AN/APG-85 is planned for Block 4 F-35s.[141] According to the JPO, the new radar will be compatible with all three major F-35 variants. However, it is unclear if older aircraft will be retrofitted with the new radar.[141] Stealth is a key aspect of the F-35's design, and radar cross-section (RCS) is minimized through careful shaping of the airframe and the use of radar-absorbent materials (RAM); visible measures to reduce RCS include alignment of edges and continuous curvature of surfaces, serration of skin panels, and the masking of the engine face and turbine. Additionally, the F-35's diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) uses a compression bump and forward-swept cowl rather than a splitter gap or bleed system to divert the boundary layer away from the inlet duct, eliminating the diverter cavity and further reducing radar signature.[107][142] The RCS of the F-35 has been characterized as lower than a metal golf ball at certain frequencies and angles; in some conditions, the F-35 compares favorably to the F-22 in stealth.[143][144][145] For maintainability, the F-35's stealth design took lessons from earlier stealth aircraft such as the F-22; the F-35's radar-absorbent fibermat skin is more durable and requires less maintenance than older topcoats.[146] The aircraft also has reduced infrared and visual signatures as well as strict controls of radio frequency emitters to prevent their detection.[147][148][149] The F-35's stealth design is primarily focused on high-frequency X-band wavelengths;[150] low-frequency radars can spot stealthy aircraft due to Rayleigh scattering, but such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and lack precision.[151][152][153] To disguise its RCS, the aircraft can mount four Luneburg lens reflectors.[154] Overseas deployments of the F-35, including the Estonia, Bulgaria, and South Korea, use these radar reflectors to prevent Russian and Chinese intelligence gathering on the true RCS signature. There were concerns that Russian involvement in the Syrian civil war allowed the country to gather true RCS data on Israeli F-35Is flying without reflectors over Lebanon, as well as US F-22s.[155] Noise from the F-35 caused concerns in residential areas near potential bases for the aircraft, and residents near two such bases—Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, and Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), Florida—requested environmental impact studies in 2008 and 2009 respectively.[156] Although the noise levels, in decibels, were comparable to those of prior fighters such as the F-16, the F-35's sound power is stronger—particularly at lower frequencies.[157] Subsequent surveys and studies have indicated that the noise of the F-35 was not perceptibly different from the F-16 and F/A-18E/F, though the greater low-frequency noise was noticeable for some observers.[158][159][160] The glass cockpit was designed to give the pilot good situational awareness. The main display is a 20-by-8-inch (50 by 20 cm) panoramic touchscreen, which shows flight instruments, stores management, CNI information, and integrated caution and warnings; the pilot can customize the arrangement of the information. Below the main display is a smaller stand-by display.[161] The cockpit has a speech-recognition system developed by Adacel.[162] The F-35 does not have a head-up display; instead, flight and combat information is displayed on the visor of the pilot's helmet in a helmet-mounted display system (HMDS).[163] The one-piece tinted canopy is hinged at the front and has an internal frame for structural strength. The Martin-Baker US16E ejection seat is launched by a twin-catapult system housed on side rails.[164] There is a right-hand side stick and throttle hands-on throttle-and-stick system. For life support, an onboard oxygen-generation system (OBOGS) is fitted and powered by the Integrated Power Package (IPP), with an auxiliary oxygen bottle and backup oxygen system for emergencies.[165] The Vision Systems International[N 13] helmet display is a key piece of the F-35's human-machine interface. Instead of the head-up display mounted atop the dashboard of earlier fighters, the HMDS puts flight and combat information on the helmet visor, allowing the pilot to see it no matter which way they are facing.[166] Infrared and night vision imagery from the Distributed Aperture System can be displayed directly on the HMDS and enables the pilot to \"see through\" the aircraft. The HMDS allows an F-35 pilot to fire missiles at targets even when the nose of the aircraft is pointing elsewhere by cuing missile seekers at high angles off-boresight.[167][168] Each helmet costs $400,000.[169] The HMDS weighs more than traditional helmets, and there is concern that it can endanger lightweight pilots during ejection.[170] Due to the HMDS's vibration, jitter, night-vision and sensor display problems during development, Lockheed Martin and Elbit issued a draft specification in 2011 for an alternative HMDS based on the AN/AVS-9 night vision goggles as backup, with BAE Systems chosen later that year.[171][172] A cockpit redesign would be needed to adopt an alternative HMDS.[173][174] Following progress on the baseline helmet, development on the alternative HMDS was halted in October 2013.[175][176] In 2016, the Gen 3 helmet with improved night vision camera, new liquid crystal displays, automated alignment and software enhancements was introduced with LRIP lot 7.[175] To preserve its stealth shaping, the F-35 has two internal weapons bays each with two weapons stations. The two outboard weapon stations each can carry ordnance up to 2,500 lb (1,100 kg), or 1,500 lb (680 kg) for the F-35B, while the two inboard stations carry air-to-air missiles. Air-to-surface weapons for the outboard station include the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Paveway series of bombs, Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), and cluster munitions (Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser). The station can also carry multiple smaller munitions such as the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), GBU-53/B StormBreaker and SPEAR 3; up to four SDBs can be carried per station for the F-35A and F-35C, and three for the F-35B.[177][178][179] The F-35A achieved certification to carry the B61 Mod 12 nuclear bomb in October 2023.[180] The inboard station can carry the AIM-120 AMRAAM and eventually the AIM-260 JATM. Two compartments behind the weapons bays contain flares, chaff, and towed decoys.[181] The aircraft can use six external weapons stations for missions that do not require stealth.[182] The wingtip pylons each can carry an AIM-9X or AIM-132 ASRAAM and are canted outwards to reduce their radar cross-section.[183][184] Additionally, each wing has a 5,000 lb (2,300 kg) inboard station and a 2,500 lb (1,100 kg) middle station, or 1,500 lb (680 kg) for F-35B. The external wing stations can carry large air-to-surface weapons that would not fit inside the weapons bays such as the AGM-158 Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) or AGM-158C LRASM cruise missile. An air-to-air missile load of eight AIM-120s and two AIM-9s is possible using internal and external weapons stations; a configuration of six 2,000 lb (910 kg) bombs, two AIM-120s and two AIM-9s can also be arranged.[167][185][186] The F-35 is armed with a 25 mm GAU-22/A rotary cannon, a lighter four-barrel variant of the GAU-12/U Equalizer.[187] On the F-35A this is mounted internally near the left wing root with 182 rounds carried;[citation needed] the gun is more effective against ground targets than the 20 mm gun carried by other USAF fighters.[dubious – discuss][citation needed] In 2020, a USAF report noted \"unacceptable\" accuracy problems with the GAU-22/A on the F-35A. These were due to \"misalignments\" in the gun's mount, which was also susceptible to cracking.[188] These problems were resolved by 2024.[189] The F-35B and F-35C have no internal gun and instead can use a Terma A/S multi-mission pod (MMP) carrying the GAU-22/A and 220 rounds; the pod is mounted on the centerline of the aircraft and shaped to reduce its radar cross-section.[187][190][verification needed] In lieu of the gun, the pod can also be used for different equipment and purposes, such as electronic warfare, aerial reconnaissance, or rear-facing tactical radar.[191][192] The pod was not susceptible to the accuracy issues that once plagued the gun on the F-35A variant,[188] though was apparently not problem-free.[189] Lockheed Martin is developing a weapon rack called Sidekick that would enable the internal outboard station to carry two AIM-120s, thus increasing the internal air-to-air payload to six missiles, currently offered for Block 4.[193][194] Block 4 will also have a rearranged hydraulic line and bracket to allow the F-35B to carry four SDBs per internal outboard station; integration of the MBDA Meteor is also planned.[195][196] The USAF and USN are planning to integrate the AGM-88G AARGM-ER internally in the F-35A and F-35C.[197] Norway and Australia are funding an adaptation of the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) for the F-35; designated Joint Strike Missile (JSM), two missiles can be carried internally with an additional four externally.[198] Both hypersonic missiles and direct energy weapons such as solid-state laser are currently being considered as future upgrades; in 2024, Lockheed Martin disclosed its proposed Mako hypersonic missile, which can be carried internally in the F-35A and C and externally on the B.[199][N 14][203] Additionally, Lockheed Martin is studying integrating a fiber laser that uses spectral beam combining multiple individual laser modules into a single high-power beam, which can be scaled to various levels.[204] The USAF plans for the F-35A to take up the close air support (CAS) mission in contested environments; amid criticism that it is not as well suited as a dedicated attack platform, USAF chief of staff Mark Welsh placed a focus on weapons for CAS sorties, including guided rockets, fragmentation rockets that shatter into individual projectiles before impact, and more compact ammunition for higher capacity gun pods.[205] Fragmentary rocket warheads create greater effects than cannon shells as each rocket creates a \"thousand-round burst\", delivering more projectiles than a strafing run.[206] The aircraft is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney F135 low-bypass augmented turbofan with rated thrust of 28,000 lbf (125 kN) at military power and 43,000 lbf (191 kN) with afterburner. Derived from the Pratt & Whitney F119 used by the F-22, the F135 has a larger fan and higher bypass ratio to increase subsonic thrust and fuel efficiency, and unlike the F119, is not optimized for supercruise.[207] The engine contributes to the F-35's stealth by having a low-observable augmenter, or afterburner, that incorporates fuel injectors into thick curved vanes; these vanes are covered by ceramic radar-absorbent materials and mask the turbine. The stealthy augmenter had problems with pressure pulsations, or \"screech\", at low altitude and high speed early in its development.[208] The low-observable axisymmetric nozzle consists of 15 partially overlapping flaps that create a sawtooth pattern at the trailing edge, which reduces radar signature and creates shed vortices that reduce the infrared signature of the exhaust plume.[209] Due to the engine's large dimensions, the U.S. Navy had to modify its underway replenishment system to facilitate at-sea logistics support.[210] The F-35's Integrated Power Package (IPP) performs power and thermal management and integrates environment control, auxiliary power unit, engine starting, and other functions into a single system.[211] The F135-PW-600 variant for the F-35B incorporates the Shaft-Driven Lift Fan (SDLF) to allow STOVL operations. Designed by Lockheed Martin and developed by Rolls-Royce, the SDLF, also known as the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem, consists of the lift fan, drive shaft, two roll posts, and a \"three-bearing swivel module\" (3BSM). The nozzle features three bearings resembling a short cylinder with nonparallel bases. As the toothed edges are rotated by motors, the nozzle swivels from being linear with the engine to being perpendicular. The thrust vectoring 3BSM nozzle allows the main engine exhaust to be deflected downward at the tail of the aircraft and is moved by a \"fueldraulic\" actuator that uses pressurized fuel as the working fluid.[212][213][214] Unlike the Harrier's Pegasus engine that entirely uses direct engine thrust for lift, the F-35B's system augments the swivel nozzle's thrust with the lift fan; the fan is powered by the low-pressure turbine through a drive shaft when engaged with a clutch and placed near the front of the aircraft to provide a torque countering that of the 3BSM nozzle.[215][216][217] Roll control during slow flight is achieved by diverting unheated engine bypass air through wing-mounted thrust nozzles called roll posts.[218][219] An alternative engine, the General Electric/Allison/Rolls-Royce F136, was being developed in the 1990s and 2000s; originally, F-35 engines from Lot 6 onward were competitively tendered. Using technology from the General Electric YF120, the F136 was claimed to have a greater temperature margin than the F135 due to the higher mass flow design making full use of the inlet.[38][220] The F136 was canceled in December 2011 due to lack of funding.[221][222] The F-35 is expected to receive propulsion upgrades over its lifecycle to adapt to emerging threats and enable additional capabilities. In 2016, the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP) was launched to develop and test adaptive cycle engines, with one major potential application being the re-engining of the F-35; in 2018, both GE and P&W were awarded contracts to develop 45,000 lbf (200 kN) thrust class demonstrators, with the designations XA100 and XA101 respectively.[77] In addition to potential re-engining, P&W is also developing improvements to the baseline F135; the Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) is an update to the power module, originally called Growth Option 1.0 and then Engine Enhancement Package, that improves engine thrust and fuel burn by 5% and bleed air cooling capacity by 50% to support Block 4.[223][224][225] The F135 ECU was selected over AETP engines in 2023 to provide additional power and cooling for the F-35. Although GE had expected that the more revolutionary XA100 could enter service with the F-35A and C by 2027 and could be adapted for the F-35B, the increased cost and risk caused the USAF to choose the F135 ECU instead.[226][79] The F-35 is designed to require less maintenance than prior stealth aircraft. Some 95% of all field-replaceable parts are \"one deep\"—that is, nothing else needs to be removed to reach the desired part; for instance, the ejection seat can be replaced without removing the canopy. The F-35 has a fibermat radar-absorbent material (RAM) baked into the skin, which is more durable, easier to work with, and faster to cure than older RAM coatings; similar coatings are being considered for application on older stealth aircraft such as the F-22.[146][227][228] Skin corrosion on the F-22 led to the F-35 using a less galvanic corrosion-inducing skin gap filler, fewer gaps in the airframe skin needing filler, and better drainage.[229] The flight control system uses electro-hydrostatic actuators rather than traditional hydraulic systems; these controls can be powered by lithium-ion batteries in case of emergency.[230][231][232] Commonality between variants led to the USMC's first aircraft maintenance Field Training Detachment, which applied USAF lessons to their F-35 operations.[233] The F-35 was initially supported by a computerized maintenance management system named Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS). In concept, any F-35 can be serviced at any maintenance facility and all parts can be globally tracked and shared as needed.[234] Due to numerous problems,[235] such as unreliable diagnoses, excessive connectivity requirements, and security vulnerabilities, ALIS is being replaced by the cloud-based Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN).[236][237][238] From September 2020, ODIN base kits (OBKs)[239] were running ALIS software, as well as ODIN software, first at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, Arizona, then at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California, in support of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 125 on 16 July 2021, and then Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, in support of the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) on 6 August 2021. In 2022, over a dozen more OBK sites will replace the ALIS's Standard Operating Unit unclassified (SOU-U) servers.[240] OBK performance is double that of ALIS.[241][240][239] The first F-35A, AA-1, conducted its engine run in September 2006 and first flew on 15 December 2006.[242] Unlike all subsequent aircraft, AA-1 did not have the weight optimization from SWAT; consequently, it mainly tested subsystems common to subsequent aircraft, such as the propulsion, electrical system, and cockpit displays. This aircraft was retired from flight testing in December 2009 and was used for live-fire testing at NAS China Lake.[243] The first F-35B, BF-1, flew on 11 June 2008, while the first weight-optimized F-35A and F-35C, AF-1 and CF-1, flew on 14 November 2009 and 6 June 2010 respectively. The F-35B's first hover was on 17 March 2010, followed by its first vertical landing the next day.[244] The F-35 Integrated Test Force (ITF) consisted of 18 aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Patuxent River. Nine aircraft at Edwards, five F-35As, three F-35Bs, and one F-35C, performed flight sciences testing such as F-35A envelope expansion, flight loads, stores separation, as well as mission systems testing. The other nine aircraft at Patuxent River, five F-35Bs and four F-35Cs, were responsible for F-35B and C envelope expansion and STOVL and CV suitability testing. Additional carrier suitability testing was conducted at Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Two non-flying aircraft of each variant were used to test static loads and fatigue.[245] For testing avionics and mission systems, a modified Boeing 737-300 with a duplication of the cockpit, the Lockheed Martin CATBird has been used.[194] Field testing of the F-35's sensors were conducted during Exercise Northern Edge 2009 and 2011, serving as significant risk-reduction steps.[246][247] Flight tests revealed several serious deficiencies that required costly redesigns, caused delays, and resulted in several fleet-wide groundings. In 2011, the F-35C failed to catch the arresting wire in all eight landing tests; a redesigned tail hook was delivered two years later.[248][249] By June 2009, many of the initial flight test targets had been accomplished but the program was behind schedule.[250] Software and mission systems were among the biggest sources of delays for the program, with sensor fusion proving especially challenging.[129] In fatigue testing, the F-35B suffered several premature cracks, requiring a redesign of the structure.[251] A third non-flying F-35B is currently planned to test the redesigned structure. The F-35B and C also had problems with the horizontal tails suffering heat damage from prolonged afterburner use.[N 15][254][255] Early flight control laws had problems with \"wing drop\"[N 16] and also made the airplane sluggish, with high angles-of-attack tests in 2015 against an F-16 showing a lack of energy.[256][257] At-sea testing of the F-35B was first conducted aboard USS Wasp. In October 2011, two F-35Bs conducted three weeks of initial sea trials, called Development Test I.[258] The second F-35B sea trials, Development Test II, began in August 2013, with tests including nighttime operations; two aircraft completed 19 nighttime vertical landings using DAS imagery.[259][260] The first operational testing involving six F-35Bs was done on the Wasp in May 2015. The final Development Test III on USS America involving operations in high sea states was completed in late 2016.[261] A Royal Navy F-35 conducted the first \"rolling\" landing on board HMS Queen Elizabeth in October 2018.[262] After the redesigned tail hook arrived, the F-35C's carrier-based Development Test I began in November 2014 aboard USS Nimitz and focused on basic day carrier operations and establishing launch and recovery handling procedures.[263] Development Test II, which focused on night operations, weapons loading, and full power launches, took place in October 2015. The final Development Test III was completed in August 2016, and included tests of asymmetric loads and certifying systems for landing qualifications and interoperability.[264] Operational test of the F-35C was conducted in 2018 and the first operational squadron achieved safe-for-flight milestone that December, paving the way for its introduction in 2019.[4][265] The F-35's reliability and availability have fallen short of requirements, especially in the early years of testing. The ALIS maintenance and logistics system was plagued by excessive connectivity requirements and faulty diagnoses. In late 2017, the GAO reported the time needed to repair an F-35 part averaged 172 days, which was \"twice the program's objective\", and that shortage of spare parts was degrading readiness.[266] In 2019, while individual F-35 units have achieved mission-capable rates of over the target of 80% for short periods during deployed operations, fleet-wide rates remained below target. The fleet availability goal of 65% was also not met, although the trend shows improvement. Internal gun accuracy of the F-35A was unacceptable until misalignment issues were addressed by 2024.[254][267] As of 2020, the number of the program's most serious issues have been decreased by half.[268][189] Operational test and evaluation (OT&E) with Block 3F, the final configuration for SDD, began in December 2018, but its completion was delayed particularly by technical problems in integration with the DOD's Joint Simulation Environment (JSE);[269] the F-35 finally completed all JSE trials in September 2023.[71] The F-35A and F-35B were cleared for basic flight training in early 2012, although there were concerns over safety and performance due to lack of system maturity at the time.[270][271][272] During the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase, the three U.S. military services jointly developed tactics and procedures using flight simulators, testing effectiveness, discovering problems and refining design. On 10 September 2012, the USAF began an operational utility evaluation (OUE) of the F-35A, including logistical support, maintenance, personnel training, and pilot execution.[273][274] The USMC F-35B Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) was initially based at Eglin AFB in 2012 alongside USAF F-35A training units, before moving to MCAS Beaufort in 2014 while another FRS was stood up at MCAS Miramar in 2020.[275][276] The USAF F-35A basic course is held at Eglin AFB and Luke AFB; in January 2013, training began at Eglin with capacity for 100 pilots and 2,100 maintainers at once.[277] Additionally, the 6th Weapons Squadron of the USAF Weapons School was activated at Nellis AFB in June 2017 for F-35A weapons instructor curriculum while the 65th Aggressor Squadron was reactivated with the F-35A in June 2022 to expand training against adversary stealth aircraft tactics.[278] The USN stood up its F-35C FRS in 2012 with VFA-101 at Eglin AFB, but operations would later be transferred and consolidated under VFA-125 at NAS Lemoore in 2019.[279] The F-35C was introduced to the Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor course, or TOPGUN, in 2020 and the additional capabilities of the aircraft greatly revamped the course syllabus.[280] On 16 November 2012, the USMC received the first F-35B of VMFA-121 at MCAS Yuma.[281] The USMC declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the F-35B in the Block 2B configuration on 31 July 2015 after operational trials, with some limitations in night operations, mission systems, and weapons carriage.[2][282] USMC F-35Bs participated in their first Red Flag exercise in July 2016 with 67 sorties conducted.[283] The first F-35B deployment occurred in 2017 at MCAS Iwakuni, Japan; combat employment began in July 2018 from the amphibious assault ship USS Essex, with the first combat strike on 27 September 2018 against a Taliban target in Afghanistan.[284] In addition to deploying F-35Bs on amphibious assault ships, the USMC plans to disperse the aircraft among austere forward-deployed bases with shelter and concealment to enhance survivability while remaining close to a battlespace. Known as distributed STOVL operations (DSO), F-35Bs would operate from temporary bases in allied territory within hostile missile engagement zones and displace inside the enemy's 24- to 48-hour targeting cycle; this strategy allows F-35Bs to rapidly respond to operational needs, with mobile forward arming and refueling points (M-FARPs) accommodating KC-130 and MV-22 Osprey aircraft to rearm and refuel the jets, as well as littoral areas for sea links of mobile distribution sites. For higher echelons of maintenance, F-35Bs would return from M-FARPs to rear-area friendly bases or ships. Helicopter-portable metal planking is needed to protect unprepared roads from the F-35B's exhaust; the USMC are studying lighter heat-resistant options.[285] These operations have become part of the larger USMC Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) concept.[286] The first USMC F-35C squadron, VMFA-314, achieved Full Operational Capability in July 2021 and was first deployed on board USS Abraham Lincoln as a part of Carrier Air Wing 9 in January 2022.[287] In 2024, Lt. Gen. Sami Sadat of Afghanistan described an operation using F-35Bs from USS Essex which bombed a Taliban position through cloud cover. \"The impact [the F-35] left on my soldiers was amazing. Like, whoa, you know, we have this technology\", Sadat said. \"But also the impact on the Taliban was quite crippling, because they have never seen Afghan forces move in the winter, and they have never seen planes that could bomb through the clouds.\"[288] On 9 November 2024, Marine F-35Cs carried out strikes on the Houthi movement in Yemen in the context of the Red Sea crisis, making it the first time the F-35C has been used in combat.[289] USAF F-35A in the Block 3i configuration achieved IOC with the USAF's 34th Fighter Squadron at Hill Air Force Base, Utah on 2 August 2016.[3] F-35As conducted their first Red Flag exercise in 2017; system maturity had improved and the aircraft scored a kill ratio of 15:1 against an F-16 aggressor squadron in a high-threat environment.[290] The first USAF F-35A deployment occurred on 15 April 2019 to Al Dhafra Air Base, UAE.[291] On 27 April 2019, USAF F-35As were first used in combat in an airstrike on an Islamic State tunnel network in northern Iraq.[292] For European basing, RAF Lakenheath in the UK was chosen as the first installation to station two F-35A squadrons, with 48 aircraft adding to the 48th Fighter Wing's existing F-15C and F-15E squadrons. The first aircraft of the 495th Fighter Squadron arrived on 15 December 2021.[293][294] The F-35's operating cost is higher than some older USAF tactical aircraft. In fiscal year 2018, the F-35A's cost per flight hour (CPFH) was $44,000, a number that was reduced to $35,000 in 2019.[295] For comparison, in 2015 the CPFH of the A-10 was $17,716; the F-15C, $41,921; and the F-16C, $22,514.[296] Lockheed Martin hopes to reduce it to $25,000 by 2025 through performance-based logistics and other measures.[297] According to US officials, F-35As and F-22s launched from land bases in the region, were used to attempt to draw surface-to-air missile fire ahead of B-2 bombing runs during the United States strikes on Iranian nuclear sites on 22 June 2025.[298][299][300] In January 2026, F-35s participated in the United States strikes in Venezuela, along with F-22s, B-1s, F/A-18s, E/A-18s, and various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft and drones. General Dan Caine claimed the aircraft were used to disable Venezuelan air defense systems to ensure the safe passage of the helicopters into the target area. The operation resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.[301] The USN achieved operational status with the F-35C in Block 3F on 28 February 2019.[4] On 2 August 2021, the F-35C of VFA-147, as well as the CMV-22 Osprey, embarked on their maiden deployments as part of Carrier Air Wing 2 on board USS Carl Vinson.[302] USN F-35Cs operating from the USS Carl Vinson took part the training exercise Pacific Stellar 2025 in February, along with the French and Japanese navies.[303] In April 2025, F-35C's from VFA-97 shot down multiple Houthi drones in the Red Sea, making it the first time the Navy has used the jet in combat.[304] The United Kingdom's Royal Air Force and Royal Navy operate the F-35B. Called Lightning in British service,[305] it has replaced the Harrier GR9, retired in 2010, and Tornado GR4, retired in 2019. The F-35 is to be Britain's primary strike aircraft for the next three decades. One of the Royal Navy's requirements was a Shipborne Rolling and Vertical Landing (SRVL) mode to increase maximum landing weight by using wing lift during landing.[306][307] Like the Italian Navy, British F-35Bs use ski-jumps to fly from their aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. British F-35Bs are not intended to use the Brimstone 2 missile.[308] In July 2013, Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton announced that No. 617 Squadron would be the RAF's first operational F-35 squadron.[309][310] The first British F-35 squadron was No. 17 (Reserve) Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES), which stood up on 12 April 2013 as the aircraft's Operational Evaluation Unit.[311] By June 2013, the RAF had received three F-35s of the 48 on order, initially based at Eglin Air Force Base.[312] In June 2015, the F-35B undertook its first launch from a ski-jump at NAS Patuxent River.[313] On 5 July 2017, it was announced the second UK-based RAF squadron would be No. 207 Squadron,[314] which reformed on 1 August 2019 as the Lightning Operational Conversion Unit (OCU).[315] No. 617 Squadron reformed on 18 April 2018 during a ceremony in Washington, D.C., becoming the first RAF front-line squadron to operate the type;[316] receiving its first four F-35Bs on 6 June, flying from MCAS Beaufort to RAF Marham.[317] On 10 January 2019, No. 617 Squadron and its F-35s were declared combat-ready.[318] April 2019 saw the first overseas deployment of a UK F-35 squadron when No. 617 Squadron went to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus.[319] This reportedly led on 25 June 2019 to the first combat use of an RAF F-35B: an armed reconnaissance flight searching for Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.[320] In October 2019, F-35s of 617 Squadron and No. 17 TES were embarked on HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time.[321] No. 617 Squadron departed RAF Marham on 22 January 2020 for their first Exercise Red Flag with the Lightning.[322] As of November 2022, 26 F-35Bs were based in the United Kingdom (with 617 and 207 Squadrons) and a further three were permanently based in the United States (with 17 Squadron) for testing and evaluation purposes.[323] The UK's second operational squadron is the Fleet Air Arm's 809 Naval Air Squadron, which stood up in December 2023.[324][325][326] In June 2025, as part of its second phase of procurement, the UK announced plans to procure 12 F-35As, capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear weapons, including the B61-12 thermonuclear gravity bomb. The aircraft will form part of NATO's dual capable aircraft programme. The F35-As will be based in RAF Marham, to be used in a training role on routine operation, as part of the OCU. 15 F-35Bs are also planned in this phase.[327][328][329] In July 2025, United States B61 nuclear weapons were redeployed to the US-operated RAF Lakenheath for the first time since 2008. The base operates F-35As and F-15Es, both capable of delivering the B61.[330][331] Australia's first F-35, designated A35-001, was manufactured in 2014, with flight training provided through international Pilot Training Centre (PTC) at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.[332] The first two F-35s were unveiled to the Australian public on 3 March 2017 at the Avalon Airshow.[333] By 2021, the Royal Australian Air Force had accepted 26 F-35As, with nine in the US and 17 operating at No 3 Squadron and No 2 Operational Conversion Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown.[332] With 41 trained RAAF pilots and 225 trained technicians for maintenance, the fleet was declared ready to deploy on operations.[334] It was originally expected that Australia would receive all 72 F-35s by 2023.[333] Its final nine aircraft, which were the TR-3 version, arrived in Australia in December 2024.[335] The Israeli Air Force (IAF) declared the F-35 operationally capable on 6 December 2017.[336] According to Kuwaiti newspaper Al Jarida, in July 2018, a test mission of at least three IAF F-35s flew to Iran's capital Tehran and back to Tel Aviv. While publicly unconfirmed, regional leaders acted on the report; Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei reportedly fired the air force chief and commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps over the mission.[337][338] On 22 May 2018, IAF chief Amikam Norkin said that the service had employed their F-35Is in two attacks on two battle fronts. This was part of the May 2018 Israel-Iran clashes, where airstrikes were claimed to target Iranian positions surrounding Syria's capital of Damascus and the buffer UNDOF Zone of the occupied Golan Heights.[339] This marks the first combat operation of an F-35 by any country.[14][340] Norkin said it had been flown \"all over the Middle East\", and showed photos of an F-35I flying over Beirut in daylight.[341] In July 2019, Israel expanded its strikes against Iranian missile shipments; IAF F-35Is allegedly struck Iranian targets in Iraq twice.[342] In November 2020, the IAF announced the delivery of a unique F-35I testbed aircraft among a delivery of four aircraft received in August, to be used to test and integrate Israeli-produced weapons and electronic systems on F-35s received later. This is the only example of a testbed F-35 delivered to a non-US air force.[343][344] On 11 May 2021, eight IAF F-35Is took part in an attack on 150 targets in Hamas' rocket array, including 50–70 launch pits in the northern Gaza Strip, as part of Operation Guardian of the Walls.[345] On 6 March 2022, the IDF stated that on 15 March 2021, F-35Is shot down two Iranian drones carrying weapons to the Gaza Strip.[346] This was the first operational shoot down and interception carried out by the F-35. They were also used in the Gaza war.[347][348][349] On 2 November 2023, the IDF posted on social media that they used an F-35I to shoot down a Houthi cruise missile over the Red Sea that was fired from Yemen during the Gaza war.[350] F-35Is were used in airstrikes against Lebanon, including aerial refuelling in the country's airspace, in August and September 2024, as part of the Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present).[351][155] F-35Is were used in the 29 September 2024 Israeli attacks on Yemen.[352] F-35Is were also reportedly involved in the October 2024 Israeli strikes on Iran.[353] The F-35 was also used during the June 2025 Israeli strikes on Iran, equipped with low-observable conformal fuel tanks to extend their range and allow operations over Iranian soil without mid-air refueling.[354] Iranian state-run media claimed that Iran shot down several Israeli F-35 jets, though the IDF denied the claims.[355][356] Italy's F-35As were declared to have reached initial operational capability (IOC) on 30 November 2018. At the time Italy had taken delivery of 10 F-35As and one F-35B, with 2 F-35As and the one F-35B being stationed in the U.S. for training, the remaining 8 F-35As were stationed in Amendola.[357] Italian Navy F-35Bs have been operating from the Italian aircraft carrier ITS Cavour, where they have also conducted drills in the Philippine Sea with the US in 2024.[358][359] Construction in 2023 showed that Ghedi Air Base is planning to host F-35As for Italian delivery of US B61 nuclear weapons under NATO nuclear sharing.[360] Japan's F-35As were declared to have reached initial operational capability (IOC) on 29 March 2019. At the time Japan had taken delivery of 10 F-35As stationed in Misawa Air Base. Japan plans to eventually acquire a total of 147 F-35s, which will include 42 F-35Bs. It plans to use the latter variant to equip Japan's Izumo-class multi-purpose destroyers.[361][362] On August 7, 2025, the first three Japanese F-35B's landed at Nyutabaru Air Base. Four more are to arrive by March 2026.[363] On 6 November 2019 Norway declared initial operational capability (IOC) for its fleet of 15 F-35As out of a planned 52 F-35As.[364] On 6 January 2022 Norway's F-35As replaced its older F-16A and B models for the NATO quick reaction alert mission in the high north.[365] In April 2025, the total number of F-35s delivered totaled 49 out of 52.[366][367] On 22 September 2023, two F-35As from the Royal Norwegian Air Force landed on a motorway near Tervo, Finland, showing, for the first time, that F-35As can operate from paved roads. Unlike the F-35B they cannot land vertically. The fighters were also refueled with their engines running. Major General Rolf Folland, Commander of the RNAF, said: \"Fighter jets are vulnerable on the ground, so by being able to use small airfields – and now motorways – (this) increases our survivability in war\",[368] On 27 December 2021, the Netherlands declared initial operational capability (IOC) for its fleet of 24 F-35As it has received to date from its order for 46 F-35As.[369] In 2022, the Netherlands announced they will order an additional six F-35s, totaling 52 aircraft ordered.[370] As of September 2024[update], 40 out of the 52 ordered have been delivered, and the Netherlands seeks to order another six jets to help completely phase out their F-16 fleet.[366] The F-35 was designed with three initial variants – the F-35A, a CTOL land-based version; the F-35B, a STOVL version capable of use either on land or on aircraft carriers; and the F-35C, a CATOBAR carrier-based version. Since then, there has been work on the design of nationally specific versions for Israel and Canada. The F-35A is the conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) variant intended for the USAF and other air forces. It is the smallest, lightest version and capable of 9 g, the highest of all variants. Although the F-35A currently conducts aerial refueling via boom and receptacle method, the aircraft can be modified for probe-and-drogue refueling if needed by the customer.[371][372] A drag chute pod can be installed on the F-35A, with the Royal Norwegian Air Force being the first operator to adopt it.[373] The F-35A has a tailhook designed to stop the aircraft during emergency situations. Unlike the more robust unit of the carrier-based F-35C, the F-35A's tailhook is a single-use device.[374] The F-35B is the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the aircraft. Similar in size to the A variant, the B sacrifices about a third of the A variant's fuel volume to accommodate the shaft-driven lift fan (SDLF).[375][376] This variant is limited to 7 g. Unlike other variants, the F-35B has no landing hook. The \"STOVL/HOOK\" control instead engages conversion between normal and vertical flight.[377][378] The F-35B is capable of Mach 1.6 (1,960 km/h; 1,220 mph) and can perform vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL).[218] The F-35C is the carrier-based variant of the aircraft, designed for catapult-assisted take-off and barrier-arrested recovery (CATOBAR) operations from aircraft carriers. Compared to the F-35A, the F-35C incorporates several modifications to meet the specific demands of carrier operations. These include larger wings with foldable wingtips to reduce the aircraft's footprint for storage, enlarged control surfaces for improved handling at low speeds, a more robust tailhook for repeated use with carrier arrestor cables, a twin-wheel nose gear, and reinforced landing gear to withstand the stresses of arrested landings.[249] The increased wing area also allows for lower landing speeds and improves both range and payload capacity. The F-35C is limited to a maximum load factor of 7.5 g.[379] The F-35I Adir (Hebrew: אדיר, meaning \"Awesome\",[380] or \"Mighty One\"[381]) is an F-35A with unique Israeli modifications. The US initially refused to allow such changes before permitting Israel to integrate its own electronic warfare systems, including sensors and countermeasures. The main computer has a plug-and-play function for add-on systems; proposals include an external jamming pod, and new Israeli air-to-air missiles and guided bombs in the internal weapon bays.[382][383] A senior IAF official said that the F-35's stealth may be partly overcome within 10 years despite a 30 to 40-year service life, thus Israel's insistence on using their own electronic warfare systems.[384] In 2010, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) considered a two-seat F-35 concept; an IAI executive noted that there was a \"known demand for two seats not only from Israel but from other air forces.\"[385] In 2008, IAI planned to produce conformal fuel tanks, as well as stealthy external fuel tanks;[386][387] these were reportedly used during the June 2025 Israeli airstrikes against Iran.[354] Israel had ordered a total of 75 F-35Is by 2023, with 36 already delivered as of November 2022.[388][389] The Canadian CF-35 was a proposed variant that would differ from the F-35A through the addition of a drogue parachute and the potential inclusion of an F-35B/C-style refueling probe.[373][390] In 2012, it was revealed that the CF-35 would employ the same boom refueling system as the F-35A.[391] One alternative proposal would have been the adoption of the F-35C for its probe refueling and lower landing speed; however, the Parliamentary Budget Officer's report cited the F-35C's limited performance and payload as being too high a price to pay.[392] Following the 2015 Federal Election the Liberal Party, whose campaign had included a pledge to cancel the F-35 procurement,[393] formed a new government and commenced an open competition to replace the existing CF-18 Hornet.[394] The CF-35 variant was deemed too expensive to develop, and was never considered. The Canadian government decided to not pursue any other modifications in the Future Fighter Capability Project, and instead focused on the potential procurement of the existing F-35A variant.[395] On 28 March 2022, the Canadian Government began negotiations with Lockheed Martin for 88 F-35As[396] to replace the aging fleet of CF-18 fighters starting in 2025.[397] The aircraft are reported to cost up to CA$19bn total with a life-cycle cost estimated at CA$77bn over the course of the F-35 program.[398][399] On 9 January 2023, Canada formally confirmed the purchase of 88 aircraft. The initial delivery to the Royal Canadian Air Force in 2026 will be 4 aircraft, followed by 6 aircraft each in 2027–2028, and the rest to be delivered by 2032.[400][401] The additional characteristics confirmed for the CF-35[inconsistent] included the drag chute pod for landings at short/icy arctic runways, as well as the 'sidekick' system, which allows the CF-35 to carry up to 6 x AIM-120D missiles internally (instead of the typical internal capacity of 4 x AIM-120 missiles on other variants).[402] In December 2021, it was reported that Lockheed Martin was developing a new variant for an unspecified foreign customer. The Department of Defense released US$49 million in funding for this work.[403] India The F-35 has been described as a relatively safe military aircraft.[528] Still, since 2014, more than a dozen have crashed or otherwise been involved in incidents that have killed or severely injured people or destroyed the aircraft. Some were caused by operator error; others by mechanical problems, some of which set the entire program back.[529] Data from Lockheed Martin: F-35 specifications,[530][531][532][533] Lockheed Martin: F-35 weaponry,[534] Lockheed Martin: F-35 Program Status,[117] F-35 Program brief,[167] FY2019 Select Acquisition Report (SAR),[379] Director of Operational Test & Evaluation[535] General characteristics Performance Armament Avionics Related development Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists"}

As a product of the United States Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, the aircraft was designed as an air superiority fighter, but also incorporates ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities. The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22 airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while program partner Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems. First flown in 1997, the F-22 descended from the Lockheed YF-22 and was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A. It replaced the F-15 Eagle in most active duty U.S. Air Force (USAF) squadrons. Although the service had originally planned to buy a total of 750 ATFs to replace its entire F-15 fleet, it later scaled down to 381 and the program was ultimately cut to 195 aircraft – 187 of them operational models – in 2009 due to political opposition from high costs, a perceived lack of air-to-air threats at the time of production, and the development of the more affordable and versatile F-35 Lightning II.[N 2] The last aircraft was delivered in 2012. The F-22 is a critical component of the USAF's tactical airpower as its most advanced air superiority fighter. While it had a protracted development and initial operational difficulties, the aircraft became the service's leading counter-air platform. Its deployments include Okinawa, the Middle East, and NATO's eastern flank. Although designed for air superiority operations, the F-22 has also carried out and supported airstrikes in Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, and Venezuela. The F-22 is expected to remain a cornerstone of the USAF's fighter fleet until its successor, the Boeing F-47 enters service around 2030.[3][4] The F-22 originated from the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program that the U.S. Air Force (USAF) initiated in 1981 to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. Intelligence reports indicated that their effectiveness would be eroded by emerging worldwide threats emanating from the Soviet Union, including new developments in surface-to-air missile systems for integrated air defense networks, the introduction of the Beriev A-50 \"Mainstay\" airborne warning and control system (AWACS), and the proliferation of the Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" and Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\" class of fighter aircraft.[5] Code-named \"Senior Sky\", the ATF would become an air superiority fighter program influenced by these threats; in the potential scenario of a Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion in Central Europe, the ATF was envisaged to support the air-land battle by spearheading offensive and defensive counter-air operations (OCA/DCA) in this highly contested environment that would then enable following echelons of NATO strike and attack aircraft to perform air interdiction against ground formations; to do so, the ATF would make an ambitious leap in capability and survivability by taking advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on the horizon, including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight control systems and avionics, more powerful propulsion systems for supersonic cruise (or supercruise) around Mach 1.5, and stealth technology for low observability.[6][7][8] The USAF published an ATF request for information (RFI) to the aerospace industry in May 1981, and following a period of concept and specification development, the ATF System Program Office (SPO) issued the demonstration and validation (Dem/Val) request for proposals (RFP) in September 1985, with requirements placing strong emphasis on stealth, supersonic cruise and maneuver. The RFP saw some alterations after its initial release, including more stringent signature reduction requirements in December 1985 and the addition of the requirement for flying technology demonstrator prototypes in May 1986.[N 3][10] Owing to the immense investments required to develop the advanced technologies, teaming among companies was encouraged. Of the seven bidding companies,[N 4] Lockheed and Northrop were selected on 31 October 1986 as Dem/Val finalists.[N 5] Lockheed, through its Skunk Works division at Burbank, California, teamed with Boeing and General Dynamics while Northrop teamed with McDonnell Douglas. These two contractor teams undertook a 50-month Dem/Val phase to compete for ATF full-scale development, culminating in the flight test of two technology demonstrator prototypes, the Lockheed YF-22 and Northrop YF-23; while they represented competing designs, the prototypes were meant for demonstrating concept viability and risk mitigation rather than a competitive flyoff.[N 6] Concurrently, Pratt & Whitney and General Electric competed for the ATF engines.[14][15] Dem/Val was focused on system engineering, technology development plans, and risk reduction over point aircraft designs; in fact, after down-select, the Lockheed team completely redesigned the airframe configuration in summer 1987 due to weight analysis, with notable changes including the wing planform from swept trapezoidal to diamond-like delta and a reduction in forebody planform area.[16][17] The team extensively used analytical and empirical methods including computational fluid dynamics and computer-aided design, wind tunnel testing (18,000 hours for Dem/Val), and radar cross-section (RCS) calculations and pole testing. Avionics were tested in ground prototypes and flying laboratories.[18] During Dem/Val, the SPO used trade studies from both teams to review the ATF system specifications and adjust or delete requirements that were significant weight and cost drivers while having marginal value. The short takeoff and landing (STOL) requirement was relaxed to delete thrust-reversers, saving substantial weight. Side looking radars and the dedicated infrared search and track (IRST) system were eventually removed as well, although space and cooling provisions were retained to allow for their later addition. The ejection seat was downgraded from a fresh design to the existing ACES II. Despite efforts by both teams to rein in weight, the takeoff gross weight estimates grew from 50,000 to 60,000 lb (22,700 to 27,200 kg), resulting in engine thrust requirement increasing from 30,000 to 35,000 lbf (133 to 156 kN) class.[19] Each team built two prototype air vehicles for Dem/Val, one for each engine option. The YF-22 had its maiden flight on 29 September 1990 and, in testing, successfully demonstrated supercruise, high angle-of-attack maneuvers, and the firing of air-to-air missiles from internal weapons bays. After the flight test of the demonstrator prototypes at Edwards Air Force Base, the teams submitted the results and their full-scale development design proposals – or Preferred System Concept – in December 1990; on 23 April 1991, the Secretary of the USAF, Donald Rice, announced the Lockheed team and Pratt & Whitney as the winners of the ATF and engine competitions.[20] Both designs met or exceeded all performance requirements; the YF-23 was considered stealthier and faster, but the YF-22, with its thrust vectoring nozzles, was more maneuverable as well as less expensive and risky, having flown considerably more test sorties and hours than its counterpart.[21][22] The press also speculated that the Lockheed team's design was more adaptable to the Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF) for replacing the F-14 Tomcat, but by fiscal year (FY) 1992, the U.S. Navy had abandoned NATF due to cost.[23] The program formally moved to full-scale development, or Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD), in August 1991. The production F-22 design (internally designated Configuration 645) had also evolved to have notable differences from the YF-22, which was immature due to being frozen relatively soon after the complete redesign in the summer of 1987.[N 7] While the overall layout was similar, the external geometry saw significant alterations; the wing's leading edge sweep angle was decreased from 48° to 42°, while the vertical stabilizers were shifted rearward and decreased in area by 20%.[25] The radome shape was changed for better radar performance, the wingtips were clipped for antennas, and the dedicated airbrake was eliminated. To improve pilot visibility and aerodynamics, the canopy was moved forward 7 inches (18 cm) and the engine inlets moved rearward 14 inches (36 cm). The shapes of the fuselage, wing, and stabilator trailing edges were refined to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics. The internal structural design was refined and reinforced, with the production airframe designed for a service life of 8,000 hours.[24][26] The revised shaping was validated with over 17,000 additional hours of wind tunnel testing and further RCS testing at Helendale, California and the USAF RATSCAT range before the first flight. Increasing weight during EMD due to demanding ballistic survivability requirements and added capabilities caused slight reductions in projected range and maneuver performance.[27] Aside from advances in air vehicle and propulsion technology, the F-22's avionics were unprecedented in complexity and scale for a combat aircraft, with the integration of multiple sensors systems and antennas, including electronic warfare, communications, identification friend or foe (IFF), and software of 1.7 million lines of code written in Ada. Avionics often became the pacing factor of the whole program. In light of rapidly advancing computing and semiconductor technology, the avionics was to employ the Department of Defense's (DoD) PAVE PILLAR systems architecture and Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) program technology; the computing and processing requirements were equivalent to multiple contemporary Cray supercomputers to achieve sensor fusion.[28][29] To enable early looks and troubleshooting for mission software development, the software was ground-tested in Boeing's Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL) and flight-tested on a Boeing 757 modified with F-22 avionics and sensors, called Flying Test Bed (FTB).[30][31] Because much of the F-22's avionics design occurred in the 1990s as the electronics industry was shifting from military to commercial applications as the predominant market, avionics upgrade efforts was initially difficult and protracted due to changing industry standards; for instance, C/C++ rather than Ada became predominant programming languages.[32][33] The roughly equal division of work amongst the team largely carried through from Dem/Val to EMD, with prime contractor Lockheed responsible for the forward fuselage and control surfaces, General Dynamics for the center fuselage, and Boeing for aft fuselage and wings. Lockheed acquired General Dynamics' fighter portfolio at Fort Worth, Texas in 1993 and thus had the majority of the airframe manufacturing, and merged with Martin Marietta in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin. While Lockheed primarily performed Dem/Val work at its Skunk Works sites in Burbank and Palmdale, California, it shifted its program office and EMD work from Burbank to Marietta, Georgia, where it performed final assembly; Boeing manufactured airframe components, performed avionics integration and developed the training systems in Seattle, Washington. The EMD contract originally ordered seven single-seat F-22As and two twin-seat F-22Bs, although the latter was canceled in 1996 to reduce development costs and the orders were converted to single seaters.[34] The first F-22A, an EMD aircraft with tail number 91-4001, was unveiled at Air Force Plant 6 in Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta on 9 April 1997 where it was officially named \"Raptor\".[N 8] The aircraft first flew on 7 September 1997, piloted by chief test pilot Alfred \"Paul\" Metz.[N 9][36][37] The Raptor's designation was briefly changed to F/A-22 starting in September 2002, mimicking the Navy's F/A-18 Hornet and intended to highlight a planned ground-attack capability amid debate over the aircraft's role and relevance. The F-22 designation was reinstated in December 2005, when the aircraft entered service.[38][39] The F-22 flight test program consisted of flight sciences, developmental test (DT), and initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) by the 411th Flight Test Squadron (FLTS) at Edwards AFB, California, as well as follow-on OT&E and development of tactics and operational employment by the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) at Nellis AFB, Nevada. Nine EMD jets assigned to the 411th FLTS would participate in the test program under the Combined Test Force (CTF) at Edwards. The first two aircraft conducted envelope expansion testing, such as flying qualities, air vehicle performance, propulsion, and stores separation. The third aircraft, the first to have production-level internal structure, tested flight loads, flutter, and stores separation, while two non-flying F-22s were built for testing static loads and fatigue. Subsequent EMD aircraft and the Boeing 757 FTB tested avionics, environmental qualifications, and observables, with the first combat-capable Block 3.0 software flying in 2001.[40] Air vehicle testing resulted in several structural design modifications and retrofits for earlier lots, including tail fin strengthening to resolve buffeting in certain conditions.[41] Raptor 4001 was retired from flight testing in 2000 and subsequently sent to Wright-Patterson AFB for survivability testing, including live fire testing and battle damage repair training.[42] Other retired EMD F-22s were repurposed as maintenance trainers.[43] Because the F-22 had been designed to defeat contemporary and projected Soviet fighters, the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 had major impacts on program funding; the DoD reduced its urgency for new weapon systems and the following years would see successive reductions in its budget. This resulted in the F-22's EMD being rescheduled and lengthened multiple times. Furthermore, the aircraft's sophistication and numerous technological innovations required extensive testing, which exacerbated the cost overruns and delays, especially from mission avionics. Some capabilities were also deferred to post-service upgrades, reducing the upfront cost but increasing total program cost.[44][45] The program transitioned to full-rate production in March 2005 and completed EMD that December, after which the test force had flown 3,496 sorties for over 7,600 flight hours.[42] As the F-22 was designed for upgrades throughout its lifecycle, the 411th FLTS and 422nd TES continued the DT/OT&E and tactics development of these upgrades.[43] Derivatives such as the X-44 thrust vectoring research aircraft and the FB-22 medium-range regional bomber were proposed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, although these were eventually abandoned. In 2006, the F-22 development team won the Collier Trophy, American aviation's most prestigious award.[46] Due to the aircraft's sophisticated capabilities, contractors have been targeted by cyberattacks and technology theft.[47] The USAF originally envisioned ordering 750 ATFs at a total program cost of $44.3 billion and procurement cost of $26.2 billion in FY 1985 dollars, with production beginning in 1994 and service entry in the mid-to-late 1990s. The 1990 Major Aircraft Review (MAR) led by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reduced this to 648 aircraft beginning in 1996 and service entry in the early-to-mid 2000s. After the end of the Cold War, this was further curtailed to 442 in the 1993 Bottom-Up Review while the USAF eventually set its requirement to 381 to support its Air Expeditionary Force structure with the last deliveries in 2013. Throughout development and production, the program was continually scrutinized for its costs and less expensive alternatives such as modernized F-15 or F-16 variants were being proposed, even though the USAF considered the F-22 to provide the greatest capability increase against peer adversaries for the investment.[48] However, funding instability had reduced the total to 339 by 1997 and production was nearly halted by Congress in 1999.[N 10] Although funds were eventually restored, the planned number continued to decline due to delays and cost overruns during EMD, slipping to 277 by 2003.[50][51] In 2004, with its focus on asymmetric counterinsurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan, the DoD under Secretary Donald Rumsfeld further cut procurement to 183 production aircraft, despite the USAF's requirement for 381;[52][53] funding for this number was reached by a multi-year procurement contract awarded in 2006, with aircraft distributed to seven combat squadrons; total program cost was projected to be $62 billion (equivalent to approximately $92.5 billion in 2024).[54] In 2008, the Congressional defense spending bill raised the number to 187.[55][56] F-22 production would support over 1,000 subcontractors and suppliers from 46 states and up to 95,000 jobs, and spanned 15 years at a peak rate of roughly two airplanes per month, about half of the initially planned rate from the 1990 MAR; after EMD aircraft contracts, the first production lot was awarded in September 2000.[57][58][59] As production wound down in 2011, the total program cost was estimated to be about $67.3 billion (about $360 million for each production aircraft delivered), with $32.4 billion spent on Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) and $34.9 billion on procurement and military construction in then year dollars. The incremental cost for an additional F-22 was estimated at $138 million (equivalent to approximately $196 million in 2024) in 2009.[60][61] In total, 195 F-22s were built. The first two were EMD aircraft in the Block 1.0[N 11] configuration for initial flight testing and envelope expansion, while the third was a Block 2.0 aircraft built to represent the internal structure of production airframes and enabled it to test full flight loads. Six more EMD aircraft were built in the Block 10 configuration for development and upgrade testing, with the last two considered essentially production-quality jets. Production for operational squadrons consisted of 74 Block 10/20 training aircraft and 112 Block 30/35 combat aircraft for a total of 186 (or 187 when accounting for Production Representative Test Vehicles and certain EMD jets);[N 1] one of the Block 30 aircraft is dedicated to flight sciences at Edwards AFB.[62][63] By 2020, Block 20 aircraft from Lot 3 onward were upgraded to Block 30 standards under the Common Configuration Plan, increasing the Block 30/35 fleet to 149 aircraft while 37 remained in the Block 20 configuration for training.[N 12][65][66] In order to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of the aircraft's stealth technology and classified capabilities to U.S. adversaries,[67][68] annual DoD appropriations acts since FY1998 have included a provision prohibiting the use of funds made available in each act to approve or license the sale of the F-22 to any foreign government.[69] Customers for U.S. fighters are acquiring earlier designs such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon or the newer F-35 Lightning II, which contains technology from the F-22 but was designed to be cheaper, more flexible, and available for export.[70] In September 2006, Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales.[71] Despite the ban, the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to report on the costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant, and another report on the effect of export sales on the U.S. aerospace industry.[72][73] Some Australian defense officials and politicians have expressed interest in procuring the F-22; in 2008, the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, stated that the aircraft was being considered by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a potential supplement to the F-35.[74][75] Some defense commentators have even advocated for the purchase in lieu of the planned F-35s, citing the F-22's known capabilities and F-35's delays and developmental uncertainties.[76][77][78] However, considerations for the F-22 were later dropped and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet would serve as the RAAF's interim aircraft prior to the F-35's service entry.[79] The Japanese government also showed interest in the F-22. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) would reportedly require fewer fighters for its mission if it obtained the F-22, thus reducing engineering and staffing costs.[80][81] With the end of F-22 production, Japan chose the F-35 in December 2011.[82] At one point the Israeli Air Force had hoped to purchase up to 50 F-22s. In November 2003, however, Israeli representatives announced that after years of analysis and discussions with Lockheed Martin and the DoD, they had concluded that Israel could not afford the aircraft.[83] Israel eventually purchased the F-35.[84][85] Throughout the 2000s when the U.S. was primarily fighting counterinsurgency wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the USAF's requirement for 381 F-22s was questioned over rising costs, initial reliability and availability problems, limited multirole versatility, and a lack of relevant adversaries for air combat missions.[70][86] In 2006, Comptroller General of the United States David Walker found that \"the DoD has not demonstrated the need\" for more investment in the F-22,[87] and further opposition was expressed by Bush Administration Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and his successor Robert Gates, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R. England, and Chairman of U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) Senators John Warner and John McCain.[88][89] Under Rumsfeld, procurement was severely cut to 183 aircraft. The F-22 lost influential supporters in 2008 after the forced resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force General T. Michael Moseley.[90] In November 2008, Gates stated that the F-22 lacked relevance in asymmetric post-Cold War conflicts,[91] and in April 2009, under the Obama Administration, he called for production to end in FY 2011 after completing 187 F-22s.[92] The loss of staunch F-22 advocates in the upper DoD echelons resulted in the erosion of its political support. In July 2008, General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated to the SASC his reasons for supporting the termination of F-22 production, including shifting resources to the multi-service F-35 and the electronic warfare EA-18G Growler.[93] Although Russian and Chinese fighter developments fueled concern for the USAF, Gates dismissed this and in 2010, he set the F-22 requirement to 187 aircraft by lowering the number of major regional conflict preparations from two to one, despite an effort by Wynne's and Moseley's successors Michael Donley and General Norton Schwartz to raise the number to 243; according to Schwartz, he and Donley finally relented in order to convince Gates to preserve the Long Range Strike Bomber program.[94][95] After President Barack Obama threatened to veto further production at Gates' urging, both the Senate and House agreed to abide by the 187 cap in July 2009.[96][97] Gates highlighted the F-35's role in the decision,[98] and believed that the U.S. would maintain its stealth fighter numbers advantage by 2025 even with F-35 delays.[99] In December 2011, the 195th and final F-22 was completed out of 8 test and 187 production aircraft built; the jet was delivered on 2 May 2012.[100][101] After production ended, F-22 tooling and associated documentation were retained and mothballed at the Sierra Army Depot to support repairs and maintenance throughout the fleet life cycle, as well as the possibility of a production restart or a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).[102][103][104] The Marietta plant space was repurposed to support the C-130J and F-35, while engineering work for sustainment and upgrades continued at Fort Worth, Texas and Palmdale, California.[104][105] The curtailed F-22 production forced the USAF to extend the service of 179 F-15C/Ds to 2026—well beyond its planned retirement—to maintain adequate air superiority fighter numbers.[106] In April 2016, Congress directed the USAF to conduct a cost study and assessment associated with resuming production of the F-22, citing advancing threats from Russia and China.[107] On 9 June 2017, the USAF submitted their report stating they had no plans to restart the F-22 production line due to cost-prohibitive economic and logistical challenges; it estimated it would cost approximately $50 billion to procure 194 additional F-22s at a cost of $206–216 million per aircraft, including approximately $9.9 billion for non-recurring start-up costs and $40.4 billion for acquisition with the first delivery in the mid-to-late 2020s. The long gap since the end of production meant hiring new workers, sourcing replacement vendors, and finding new plant space, contributing to the high start-up costs and lead times. The USAF believed that the funding would be better invested in its next-generation Air Superiority 2030 effort, which evolved into the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD).[108][105] Starting in 2019, to replace its aging F-15C/D still remaining in inventory, the USAF procured a number of new-build F-15EX, which minimized start-up costs by using an active export production line.[109] The F-22 and its subsystems were designed to be upgraded over its life cycle via numbered Increments[N 13] and Operational Flight Program (OFP) updates in anticipation for technological advances and evolving threats, although this initially proved difficult and costly due to the highly integrated avionics systems architecture.[110] Amid debates over the airplane's relevance in asymmetric counterinsurgency warfare, the first upgrades primarily focused on ground attack, or strike capabilities. Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) employment was added with Increment 2 in 2005 and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) was integrated with 3.1 in 2011; the improved AN/APG-77(V)1 radar, which incorporates air-to-ground modes, was certified in March 2007 and fitted on airframes from Lot 5 onward.[N 14][112][113] To address oxygen deprivation issues, F-22s were fitted with an automatic backup oxygen system (ABOS) and modified life support system starting in 2012.[114] In contrast to prior upgrades, Increment 3.2 emphasized air combat capabilities with updates to electronic warfare, CNI (including Link 16 receive), and geolocation as well as AIM-9X and AIM-120D integration.[115] Fleet releases of the two-part process began in 2013 and 2019 respectively. Concurrently, OFP updates added Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System, cryptographic enhancements, and improved avionics stability, among others.[116][117] A MIDS-JTRS terminal, which includes Mode 5 IFF and Link 16 transmit/receive capability, was installed starting in 2021.[118][32] To address obsolescence and modernization difficulties, the F-22's mission computers were upgraded in 2021 with military-hardened commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) open mission system (OMS) processor modules with a modular open systems architecture (MOSA). Agile software development process in conjunction with an orchestration system was implemented to enable faster upgrades from additional vendors, and software updates shifted away from Increments developed using the waterfall model to numbered annual releases.[119][120] Additional upgrades being tested include new sensors and antennas, integration of new weapons including the AIM-260 JATM, and reliability improvements such as more durable stealth coatings; the dedicated infrared search and track (IRST), originally deleted during Dem/Val, is one of the sensors added.[121][122][123] Other developments include all-aspect IRST functionality for the Missile Launch Detector (MLD),[N 15] manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) capability with uncrewed collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) or \"loyal wingmen\", and integration of the Gentex/Raytheon (later Thales USA) Scorpion helmet-mounted display (HMD).[N 16][32][125] To preserve the aircraft's stealth while enabling additional payload and fuel capacity, stealthy external carriage has been investigated since the early-2000s, with a low drag, low-observable external tank and pylon under development to increase stealthy combat radius.[126] The F-22 has also been used a platform to test and apply technologies from the NGAD program.[127] Not all proposed upgrades have been implemented. The planned Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) integration was cut due to development delays and lack of proliferation. While Block 20 aircraft from Lot 3 onwards have been upgraded to Block 30/35 under the Common Configuration Plan, Lockheed Martin in 2017 had also proposed upgrading all remaining Block 20 training aircraft to Block 30/35 as well to increase numbers available for combat; this was not pursued due to other budget priorities.[66] Aside from modernizations, the F-22's structural design and construction was improved over the course of the production run; for instance, aircraft from Lot 3 onwards had improved stabilators built by Vought.[128][129] The fleet underwent a $350 million \"structures repair/retrofit program\" (SRP) to resolve problems identified during testing as well as address improper titanium heat treatment in the parts of early batches.[130][41] By January 2021, all aircraft had gone through the SRP to ensure full service lives for the entire fleet.[131][132] The F-22 has also been used to test and qualify alternative fuels, including a synthetic jet fuel consisting of 50/50 mix of JP-8 and a Fischer–Tropsch process-produced, natural gas-based fuel in August 2008, and a 50% mixture of biofuel derived from camelina in March 2011.[133][134] The F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation air superiority fighter that is considered fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF.[135] It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and integrated avionics (or sensor fusion) in a single weapons platform to enable it to survive and conduct missions, primarily offensive and defensive counter-air operations, in highly contested environments.[38] The F-22's shape combines stealth and aerodynamic performance. Planform and panel edges are aligned at common angular aspects and the surfaces, also aligned accordingly, have continuous curvature to minimize the aircraft's radar cross-section.[136] Its clipped diamond-like delta wings have the leading edge swept 42°, trailing edge swept −17°, a slight anhedral and a conical camber to reduce supersonic wave drag. The shoulder-mounted wings are smoothly blended into the fuselage with four empennage surfaces and leading edge root extensions running to the caret inlets' upper edges, where the forebody chines also meet. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails (stabilators); for air braking, the ailerons deflect up, flaperons down, and rudders outwards to increase drag.[137][30] Owing to the focus on supersonic performance, area rule is applied extensively to the airplane's shape and nearly all of the fuselage volume lies ahead of the wing's trailing edge to reduce drag at supersonic speeds, with the stabilators pivoting from tail booms extending aft of the engine nozzles.[138] Weapons are carried internally in the fuselage for stealth. The jet has a retractable tricycle landing gear and an emergency tailhook.[30] Fire suppression system and fuel tank inerting system are installed for survivability.[139][140] The aircraft's dual Pratt & Whitney F119 augmented turbofan engines are closely spaced and incorporate rectangular two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzles with a range of ±20 degrees in the pitch-axis; the nozzles are fully integrated into the F-22's flight controls and vehicle management system. Each engine has dual-redundant Hamilton Standard full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) and maximum thrust in the 35,000 lbf (156 kN) class. The F-22's thrust-to-weight ratio at typical combat weight is nearly at unity in maximum military power and 1.25 in full afterburner. The fixed shoulder-mounted caret inlets are offset from the forward fuselage to bypass the turbulent boundary layer and generate oblique shocks with the upper inboard corners to ensure good total pressure recovery and efficient supersonic flow compression.[141] Maximum speed without external stores is approximately Mach 1.8 in supercruise at military/intermediate power and greater than Mach 2 with afterburners.[N 17] With 18,000 lb (8,165 kg) of internal fuel and an additional 8,000 lb (3,629 kg) in two 600-gallon external tanks, the jet has a ferry range of over 1,600 nmi (1,840 mi; 2,960 km).[144] The aircraft has a refueling boom receptacle centered on its spine and an auxiliary power unit embedded in the left wing root.[145] The F-22's high cruise speed and operating altitude over prior fighters improve the effectiveness of its sensors and weapon systems, and increase survivability against ground defenses such as surface-to-air missiles.[146][147] Its ability to supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using afterburners, allows it to intercept targets that afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach. The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured fighters due to a lack of parasitic drag from external stores.[148] The F-22's thrust and aerodynamics enable regular combat speeds of Mach 1.5 at 50,000 feet (15,000 m), thus providing 50% greater employment range for air-to-air missiles and twice the effective range for JDAMs than with prior platforms.[N 18][150][151] Its structure contains a significant amount of high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively, titanium alloys and bismaleimide/epoxy composites comprise 42% and 24% of the structural weight; the materials and multiple load path structural design also enable good ballistic survivability.[N 19][152][153] The airplane's aerodynamics, relaxed stability, and powerful thrust-vectoring engines give it excellent maneuverability and energy potential across its flight envelope, capable of 9-g maneuvers at takeoff gross weight with full internal fuel.[143] Its large control surfaces, vortex-generating chines and LERX, and vectoring nozzles provide excellent high alpha (angle of attack) characteristics, and is capable of flying at trimmed alpha of over 60° while maintaining roll control and performing maneuvers such as the Herbst maneuver (J-turn) and Pugachev's Cobra;[154] vortex impingement on the vertical tail fins did cause more buffeting than initially anticipated, resulting in the strengthening of the fin structure by changing the rear spar from composite to titanium.[155][156] The computerized triplex-redundant fly-by-wire control system and FADEC make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable, thus giving the pilot carefree handling.[157][148] The F-22 was designed to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar, with radio waves reflected, scattered, or diffracted away from the emitter source towards specific sectors, or absorbed and attenuated. Measures to reduce RCS include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges and continuous curvature of surfaces, internal carriage of weapons, fixed-geometry serpentine inlet ducts and curved vanes that prevent line-of-sight of the engine fan faces and turbines from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return.[136] The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio frequency emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye.[158] The aircraft's rectangular thrust-vectoring nozzles flatten the exhaust plume and facilitate its mixing with ambient air through shed vortices, which reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing (\"heat seeking\") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles.[159][160] Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special topcoat and active cooling to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.[161][136] Compared to previous stealth designs, the F-22 is less reliant on RAM, which are maintenance-intensive and susceptible to adverse weather conditions, and can undergo repairs on the flight line or in a normal hangar without climate control. The F-22 incorporates a Signature Assessment System which delivers warnings when the radar signature is degraded and necessitates repair.[154] While the F-22's exact RCS is classified, in 2009 Lockheed Martin released information indicating that from certain angles the airplane has an RCS of 0.0001 m2 or −40 dBsm – equivalent to the radar reflection of a \"steel marble\"; the aircraft can mount a Luneburg lens reflector to mask its RCS.[162][163] For missions where stealth is required, the mission capable rate is 62–70%.[N 20] Beginning in 2021, the F-22 has been seen testing a new chrome-like surface coating, speculated to help reduce the F-22's detectability by infrared tracking systems.[165][166] The effectiveness of the stealth characteristics is difficult to gauge. The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of the aircraft's frontal or side area from the perspective of a static radar. When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a completely different set of angles and surface area, potentially increasing radar observability. Furthermore, the F-22's stealth contouring and radar-absorbent materials are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars such as weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the F-22 due to its physical size. These are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and have low precision.[167] Additionally, while faint or fleeting radar contacts make defenders aware that a stealth aircraft is present, reliably vectoring interception to attack the aircraft is much more challenging.[168][169] The aircraft has an integrated avionics system where through sensor fusion, data from all onboard sensor systems as well as off-board inputs are filtered and processed into a combined tactical picture, thus enhancing the pilot's situational awareness and reducing workload. Key mission systems include Sanders/General Electric AN/ALR-94 electronic warfare system, Martin Marietta AN/AAR-56 infrared and ultraviolet Missile Launch Detector (MLD), Westinghouse/Texas Instruments AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, TRW AN/ASQ-220 Communication/Navigation/Identification (CNI) suite, and Raytheon advanced infrared search and track (IRST) being tested.[170][171][172] The APG-77 radar has a low-observable, active-aperture, electronically scanned antenna with multiple target track-while-scan in all weather conditions; the antenna is tilted back for stealth. Its emissions can be focused to overload enemy sensors as an electronic attack capability. The radar changes frequencies more than 1,000 times per second to lower interception probability and has an estimated range of 125–150 mi (201–241 km) against an 11 sq ft (1 m2) target and 250 mi (400 km) or more in narrow beams. The upgraded APG-77(V)1 provides air-to-ground functionality through synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mapping, ground moving target indication/track (GMTI/GMTT), and strike modes.[112][154] The ALR-94 electronic warfare system, among the most technically complex equipment on the F-22, integrates more than 30 antennas blended into the wings and fuselage for all-round radar warning receiver (RWR) coverage and threat geolocation. It can be used as a passive detector capable of searching targets at ranges (250+ nmi) exceeding the radar's, and can provide enough information for a target lock through narrowband interleaved search-and-rack (NBILST) and cue radar emissions to a narrow beam (down to 2° by 2° in azimuth and elevation). Depending on the detected threat, the defensive systems can prompt the pilot to release countermeasures such as flares or chaff.[173] To ensure stealth in the radio frequency spectrum, the ASQ-220 CNI emissions are strictly controlled and confined to specific sectors, with tactical communication between F-22s performed using the directional Inter/Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL). The CNI system also manages TACAN, IFF (including Mode 5), and communication through various methods such as HAVE QUICK/SATURN, SINCGARS, and later Link 16.[174][175] Additional passive detection methods include the AAR-56 Missile Launch Detector, which uses six sensors to provide full spherical infrared coverage; the sensors are being updated to the TacIRST for improved detection and survivability measures. Separately, the advanced IRST, housed in a stealthy wing pod, is a narrow field-of-view sensor for long-range passive identification and targeting.[176] The aircraft was also upgraded with an automatic ground collision avoidance system (GCAS).[177] Information from radar, CNI, and other sensors are processed by two Hughes Common Integrated Processor (CIP) mission computers, each capable of processing up to 10.5 billion instructions per second.[173][178] The F-22's baseline software has some 1.7 million lines of code, the majority involving the mission systems such as processing radar data.[179] The highly integrated nature of the avionics architecture system, as well as the use of the programming language Ada,[N 21] has made the development and testing of upgrades challenging. To enable more rapid upgrades, the CIPs were upgraded with Curtiss-Wright open mission systems (OMS) processor modules as well as a modular open systems architecture called the Open Systems Enclave (OSE) orchestration platform to allow the avionics suite to interface with containerized software from third-party vendors.[32][181] The F-22's ability to operate close to the battlefield gives the aircraft threat detection and identification capability comparative with the RC-135 Rivet Joint, and the ability to function as a \"mini-AWACS\", though its radar is less powerful than those of dedicated platforms. This allows the F-22 to rapidly designate targets for allies and coordinate friendly aircraft.[154][182] Although communication with other aircraft types was initially limited to voice, upgrades have enabled data to be transferred through a Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) or via JTIDS/Link 16 traffic through MIDS-JTRS.[118] The IEEE 1394B bus developed for the F-22 was derived from the commercial IEEE 1394 \"FireWire\" bus system.[183] In 2007, the F-22's radar was tested as a wireless data transceiver, transmitting data at 548 megabits per second and receiving at gigabit speed, far faster than the Link 16 system.[184] The aircraft's radio frequency receivers provide electronic support measures (ESM) and the ability to perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) tasks.[185][186] The F-22 has a glass cockpit with all-digital flight instruments. The monochrome head-up display offers a wide field of view and serves as a primary flight instrument; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels.[187] The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles. The USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky and was abandoned.[188] The canopy's dimensions are approximately 140 inches long, 45 inches wide, and 27 inches tall (355 cm × 115 cm × 69 cm) and weighs 360 pounds.[189] The canopy was redesigned after the original design lasted an average of 331 hours instead of the required 800 hours. Although the F-22 was originally intended to have a helmet mounted display (HMD), this was deferred during development to save costs; the aircraft is currently integrating the Scorpion HMD.[86] The F-22 has integrated radio functionality, the signal processing systems are virtualized rather than as a separate hardware module.[190] The integrated control panel (ICP) is a keypad system for entering communications, navigation, and autopilot data. Two 3 in × 4 in (7.6 cm × 10.2 cm) up-front displays located around the ICP are used to display integrated caution advisory/warning (ICAW) data, CNI data and also serve as the stand-by flight instrumentation group and fuel quantity indicator for redundancy.[191] The stand-by flight group displays an artificial horizon, for basic instrument meteorological conditions. The 8 in × 8 in (20 cm × 20 cm) primary multi-function display (PMFD) is located under the ICP, and is used for navigation and situation assessment. Three 6.25 in × 6.25 in (15.9 cm × 15.9 cm) secondary multi-function displays are located around the PMFD for tactical information and stores management.[192] The ejection seat is a version of the ACES II commonly used in USAF aircraft, with a center-mounted ejection control.[193] The F-22 has a complex life support system, which includes the onboard oxygen generation system (OBOGS), protective pilot garments, and a breathing regulator/anti-g (BRAG) valve controlling flow and pressure to the pilot's mask and garments. The pilot garments were developed under the Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit (ATAGS) project and protect against chemical/biological hazards and cold-water immersion, counter g-forces and low pressure at high altitudes, and provide thermal relief.[194] Following a series of hypoxia-related issues, the life support system was consequently revised to include an automatic backup oxygen system and a new flight vest valve.[114] In combat environments, the ejection seat includes a modified M4 carbine designated the GAU-5/A.[195] The F-22 has three internal weapons bays: a large main bay on the bottom of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine inlets; a small bay for countermeasures such as flares is located behind each side bay.[196] The main bay is split along the centerline and can accommodate six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and each side bay has an LAU-141/A launcher for short-range missiles. The primary air-to-air missiles are the AIM-120 AMRAAM and the AIM-9 Sidewinder, with planned integration of the AIM-260 JATM.[197] Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less than a second, during which pneumatic or hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft; this is to reduce vulnerability to detection and to deploy missiles during high-speed flight.[198] An internally mounted M61A2 Vulcan 20 mm rotary cannon is embedded in the airplane's right wing root with the muzzle covered by a retractable door, which remains closed when the cannon is not firing in order to minimize the negative effect the exposed muzzle on the aircraft's radar signature[199] The radar projection of the cannon fire's path is displayed on the pilot's head-up display.[200] Although designed for air-to-air missiles, the main bay can replace four launchers with two bomb racks that can each carry one 1,000 lb (450 kg) or four 250 lb (110 kg) bombs for a total of 2,000 pounds (910 kg) of air-to-surface ordnance.[201][38] In 2024, Lockheed Martin disclosed its proposed Mako hypersonic missile, a 1,300 lb (590 kg) weapon that can be carried internally in the F-22.[202] While capable of carrying weapons with GPS guidance such as JDAMs and SDBs, the F-22 cannot self-designate laser-guided weapons.[203] While the F-22 typically carries weapons internally, the wings include four hardpoints, each rated to handle 5,000 lb (2,300 kg). Each hardpoint can accommodate a pylon that can carry a detachable 600-gallon (2,270 L) external fuel tank or a launcher holding two air-to-air missiles; the two inboard hardpoints are \"plumbed\" for external fuel tanks. The two outboard hardpoints have since been dedicated to a pair of stealthy pods housing the IRST and mission systems. The aircraft can jettison external tanks and their pylon attachments to restore its low observable characteristics and kinematic performance.[204] Each F-22 requires a three-week packaged maintenance plan (PMP) every 300 flight hours.[205] Its stealth coatings were designed to be more robust and weather-resistant than those of earlier stealth aircraft,[154] yet early coatings failed against rain and moisture when F-22s were initially posted to Guam in 2009.[206] Stealth measures account for almost one third of maintenance, with coatings being particularly demanding.[207][32] F-22 depot maintenance is performed at Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill AFB, Utah; considerable care is taken during maintenance due to the small fleet size and limited attrition reserve.[208] F-22s were available for missions 63% of the time on average in 2015, up from 40% when it was introduced in 2005. Maintenance hours per flight hour was also improved from 30 early on to 10.5 by 2009, lower than the requirement of 12; man-hours per flight hour was 43 in 2014. When introduced, the F-22 had a Mean Time Between Maintenance (MTBM) of 1.7 hours, short of the required 3.0; this rose to 3.2 hours in 2012.[86][41] By fiscal year 2015, the cost per flight hour was $59,116, while the user reimbursement rate was approximately US$35,000 (~$42,237 in 2024) per flight hour in 2019.[209][210] The F-22 underwent extensive testing before its service introduction. While the first production aircraft was delivered to Edwards AFB in October 2002 for IOT&E and the first jet for the 422nd TES at Nellis AFB arrived in January 2003, IOT&E was continually pushed back from its planned start in mid-2003, with mission avionics stability being particularly challenging.[N 22][155] Following a preliminary assessment, called OT&E Phase 1, formal IOT&E began in April 2004 and was completed in December of that year. This milestone marked the successful demonstration of the jet's air-to-air mission capability, although the jet was more maintenance intensive than expected.[211] A Follow-On OT&E (FOT&E) in 2005 cleared the F-22's air-to-ground mission capability.[212] The first combat ready F-22 of the 1st Fighter Wing arrived at Langley AFB, Virginia in January 2005 and that December, the USAF announced that the aircraft had achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) with the 94th Fighter Squadron.[213] The unit subsequently participated in Exercise Northern Edge 06 in Alaska in June 2006 and Exercise Red Flag 07–2 at Nellis AFB in February 2007, where it demonstrated the F-22's greatly increased air combat capabilities when flying against Red Force Aggressor F-15s and F-16s with a simulated kill ratio of 108–0. These large force exercises also further refined the F-22's operational tactics and employment.[54][214] The F-22 achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC) in December 2007, when General John Corley of Air Combat Command (ACC) officially declared the F-22s of the integrated active duty 1st Fighter Wing and Virginia Air National Guard 192nd Fighter Wing fully operational.[215] This was followed by an Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI) of the integrated wing in April 2008, in which it was rated \"excellent\" in all categories, with a simulated kill-ratio of 221–0.[216] The fielding of the F-22 with its precision strike capability also contributed to the retirement of the F-117 from operational service in 2008, with the 49th Fighter Wing operating the F-22 for a brief period prior to a series of fleet consolidations to reduce long term operational costs;[217] further consolidations to improve availability and pilot training were recommended by the Government Accountability Office in 2018.[218] The 43rd Fighter Squadron was reactivated in 2002 as the F-22 Formal Training Unit (FTU) for the type's basic course at Tyndall AFB and the first aircraft for pilot training was delivered in September 2003. Following severe damage to the installation in the wake of Hurricane Michael in 2018, the squadron and its aircraft were relocated to nearby Eglin AFB; although it was initially feared that several jets were lost due to storm damage, all were later repaired and flown out.[219] The FTU and its aircraft were reassigned to the 71st Fighter Squadron at Langley AFB in 2023.[220] As of 2014, B-Course students require 38 sorties to graduate (previously 43 sorties). Track 1 course pilots, pilots retraining from other aircraft, also saw a reduction in the number of sorties needed to graduate, from 19 to 12 sorties.[221] F-22 students are first trained on the T-38 Talon trainer aircraft. Additional pilot training takes place on the F-16 because the aging T-38 is not rated to sustain higher G-forces and lacks modern avionics.[222] Due to a lack of a modern trainer stand-in that can accurately emulate the F-22, the Air Force often uses F-22s to supplement training, which is costly as the F-22 costs almost 10 times more than the T-38 per flight hour.[223] The upcoming T-7 Red Hawk features modern avionics that better approximate those of the F-22 and F-35.[224] This is scheduled to enter initial operating capability in 2027, several years behind schedule.[225] In 2014 the Air Force stood up the 2nd Fighter Training Squadron at Tyndall AFB which was equipped with T-38s to serve as adversary aircraft to reduce adversary training flights on the F-22s.[226] To reduce operating costs and prolong the F-22's service life, some pilot training sorties are performed using flight simulators.[205] The advanced F-22 weapons instructor course at USAF Weapons School is conducted by the 433rd Weapons Squadron at Nellis AFB.[227] During the initial years of service, F-22 pilots experienced symptoms as a result of oxygen system issues that include loss of consciousness, memory loss, emotional lability and neurological changes as well as lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; the issues resulted in a fatal mishap in 2010 and four-month grounding in 2011 and subsequent altitude and distance flight restrictions.[228][229] In August 2012, the DoD found that the BRAG valve, which inflated the pilot's vest at high-g, was defective and restricted breathing and the OBOGS (onboard oxygen generation system) unexpectedly fluctuated oxygen supply at high g.[230][231] In 2005, the Raptor Aeromedical Working Group had recommended oxygen system changes that were unfunded, but received reconsideration in 2012.[232][233] The F-22 CTF and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron eventually determined breathing restrictions as the root cause; coughing symptoms were attributed to acceleration atelectasis[N 23] from high g exposure and OBOGS delivering excessive oxygen concentration. The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed unrelated.[234] Modifications to the life support and oxygen systems, including the installation of an automatic backup, allowed altitude and distance restrictions to be lifted in April 2013.[235] Following IOC and large-scale exercises, the F-22 flew its first homeland defense mission in January 2007 under Operation Noble Eagle. In November 2007, F-22s of 90th Fighter Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, performed their first North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) interception of two Russian Tu-95MS bombers.[236] Since then, F-22s have also escorted probing Tu-160 bombers.[237] The F-22 was first deployed overseas in February 2007 with the 27th Fighter Squadron to Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan.[238] This first overseas deployment was initially marred by problems when six F-22s flying from Hickam AFB, Hawaii, experienced multiple software-related system failures while crossing the International Date Line (180th meridian of longitude). The aircraft returned to Hawaii by following tanker aircraft. Within 48 hours, the error was resolved and the journey resumed.[239][240] Kadena would be a frequent rotation for F-22 units; they have also been involved in training exercises in South Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines.[241][242][243] Defense Secretary Gates initially refused to deploy F-22s to the Middle East in 2007;[244] the type made its first deployment in the region at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE in 2009. In April 2012, F-22s have been rotating into Al Dhafra, less than 200 miles from Iran.[245][246] In March 2013, the USAF announced that an F-22 had intercepted an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that approached within 16 miles of an MQ-1 Predator flying off the Iranian coastline.[247] On 22 September 2014, F-22s performed the type's first combat sorties by conducting some of the opening strikes of Operation Inherent Resolve, the American-led intervention in Syria; aircraft dropped 1,000-pound GPS-guided bombs on Islamic State targets near Tishrin Dam.[248][249] Between September 2014 and July 2015, F-22s flew 204 sorties over Syria, dropping 270 bombs at some 60 locations.[250] Throughout their deployment, F-22s conducted close air support (CAS) and also deterred Syrian, Iranian, and Russian aircraft from attacking U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and disrupting U.S. operations in the region.[251][252][253] F-22s also participated in the U.S. strikes that defeated pro-Assad and Russian Wagner Group paramilitary forces near Khasham in eastern Syria on 7 February 2018.[254][255][256] These strikes notwithstanding, the F-22's main role in the operation was conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.[257] The aircraft also performed missions in other regions of the Middle East; in November 2017, F-22s operating alongside B-52s bombed opium production and storage facilities in Taliban-controlled regions of Afghanistan.[258][209] To increase deployment responsiveness and reduce logistical footprint in a peer or near-peer conflict, the USAF developed a deployment concept called Rapid Raptor which involves two to four F-22s and one C-17 for logistical support, first proposed in 2008 by two F-22 pilots. The goal was for the type to be able to set up and engage in combat within 24 hours in smaller and more austere environments that would enable more dispersed and survivable disposition of forces. This concept was tested at Wake Island in 2013 and Guam in late 2014.[259][260][261] Four F-22s were deployed to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany, Łask Air Base in Poland, and Ämari Air Base in Estonia in August and September 2015 to further test the concept and train with NATO allies in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.[262] The USAF would build on the principles of Rapid Raptor and eventually integrate it into its new operational concept called Agile Combat Employment, which shifts towards distributed operations during peer conflicts; for instance, detachments of F-22s have operated from austere airfields on Tinian and Iwo Jima during exercises.[263][264] On 4 February 2023, an F-22 of the 1st Fighter Wing shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon within visual range off the coast of South Carolina at an altitude of 60,000 to 65,000 feet (20,000 m),[265] marking the F-22's first air-to-air kill.[266] The wreckage landed approximately 6 miles offshore and was subsequently secured by ships of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard.[267] F-22s shot down additional high-altitude objects near the coast of Alaska on 10 February and over Yukon on 11 February.[268] The USAF expects to begin retiring the F-22 in the 2030s as it gets replaced by the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) sixth-generation crewed fighter, the Boeing F-47.[269][270][271][272] In May 2021, Air Force Chief of Staff Charles Q. Brown Jr. said that he envisioned a reduction in the future number of fighter fleets to \"four plus one\": the F-22 followed by NGAD, the F-35A, the F-15E followed by F-15EX, the F-16 followed by \"MR-X\", and the A-10; the A-10 was later dropped from the plans due to that aircraft's accelerated retirement.[273][274] In 2022 the Air Force requested that it be allowed to divest all but three of its Block 20 F-22s at Tyndall AFB.[275] Congress denied the request to divest its 33 non-combat-coded Block 20 aircraft and passed language prohibiting the divestment through FY2026.[276] While the Block 30/35 F-22 remains one of the USAF's top priorities and will be continually updated, the service believes the Block 20 aircraft is obsolescent and unsuitable even for training F-22 pilots and that upgrading them to Block 30/35 standards would be cost-prohibitive at $3.5 billion.[277][278] In September of 2025, Lockheed Martin revealed plans to modify 35 Block 20 F-22s, used for training purposes, to combat ready Block 30/35 F-22s.[279] According to US officials, F-22s and F-35As launched from land bases in the Middle East, were used to attempt to draw surface-to-air missile fire ahead of B-2 bombing runs during the United States strikes on Iranian nuclear sites on 22 June 2025.[280][281][282] In January 2026, F-22s along with F-35s, B-1s, F/A-18s, E/A-18s alongside various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft; and numerous drones were used to dismantle and disable the air defense systems in Venezuela to ensure the safe passage of the helicopters into the target area. The operation resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.[283] The X-44 MANTA, or multi-axis, no-tail aircraft, was a planned experimental aircraft based on the F-22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup.[286] The aircraft was to be solely controlled by thrust vectoring, without featuring any rudders, ailerons, or elevators. Funding for this program was halted in 2000.[287] The FB-22 was proposed in the early 2000s as a supersonic stealth regional bomber for the USAF.[288] The design went through several iterations and the later ones would combine an F-22 fuselage with greatly enlarged delta wings and was projected to carry up to 30 Small Diameter Bombs to over 1,600 nmi (3,000 km), about twice the combat range of the F-22A.[289] The FB-22 proposals were cancelled with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments, in lieu of a larger subsonic strategic bomber with a much greater range; this became the Next-Generation Bomber, although it would be rescoped in 2009 as the Long Range Strike Bomber resulting in the B-21 Raider.[126][290][291] In August 2018, Lockheed Martin proposed an F-22 derivative to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) for its 5th/6th generation F-X program. The design, which was later also proposed to the USAF, would combine a modified F-22 airframe with enlarged wings to increase fuel capacity and combat radius to 1,200 nmi (2,200 km) as well as the avionics and improved stealth coatings of the F-35.[292][293] The proposal was ultimately not considered by the USAF or JASDF due to cost as well as existing export restrictions and industrial workshare concerns.[294][295] The United States Air Force is the only operator of the F-22. As of August 2022, it has 178 active aircraft in its inventory.[296][38] Current units are bolded. The first F-22 crash occurred during takeoff at Nellis AFB on 20 December 2004, in which the pilot ejected safely before impact.[303] The investigation revealed that a brief interruption in power during an engine shutdown prior to flight caused a flight-control system malfunction;[304] consequently the aircraft design was corrected to avoid the problem. Following a brief grounding, F-22 operations resumed after a review.[305] On 25 March 2009, an EMD F-22 crashed 35 miles (56 km) northeast of Edwards AFB during a test flight, resulting in the death of Lockheed Martin test pilot David P. Cooley. An Air Force Materiel Command investigation found that Cooley momentarily lost consciousness during a high-G maneuver, or g-LOC, then ejected when he found himself too low to recover. Cooley was killed during ejection by blunt-force trauma from windblast due to the aircraft's speed. The investigation found no design issues.[306][307] On 16 November 2010, an F-22 from Elmendorf AFB crashed, killing the pilot, Captain Jeffrey Haney. F-22s were restricted to flying below 25,000 feet, then grounded during the investigation.[308] The crash was attributed to a bleed air system malfunction after an engine overheat condition was detected, shutting down the Environmental Control System (ECS) and OBOGS. The accident review board ruled Haney was to blame, as he did not react properly to engage the emergency oxygen system.[309] Haney's widow sued Lockheed Martin, claiming equipment defects, and later reached a settlement.[310][234] After the ruling, the emergency oxygen system engagement handle was redesigned and the entire system was eventually replaced by an automatic backup.[311][312] On 11 February 2013, the DoD's Inspector General released a report stating that the USAF had erred in blaming Haney, and that facts did not sufficiently support conclusions; the USAF stated that it stood by the ruling.[313] On 15 November 2012, an F-22 crashed to the east of Tyndall AFB during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely and no injuries were reported on the ground.[314] The investigation determined that a \"chafed\" electrical wire ignited the fluid in a hydraulic line, causing a fire that damaged the flight controls.[315] On 15 May 2020, an F-22 from Eglin Air Force Base crashed during a routine training mission shortly after takeoff; the pilot ejected safely. The cause of the crash was attributed to a maintenance error after an aircraft wash resulting in faulty air data sensor readings.[316] Data from USAF,[38] manufacturers' data,[319][320][321] Aerofax,[322] Aviation Week,[154][323] Air Forces Monthly,[144] and Journal of Electronic Defense[175] General characteristics Performance Armament Avionics Related development Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists"}

The X-35 was declared the winner over the competing Boeing X-32 and a developed, armed version went on to enter production in the early 21st century as the F-35 Lightning II. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) evolved out of several requirements for a common fighter to replace existing types, including the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter (CALF) program, one of the JSF's predecessors. The actual JSF development contract was signed on 16 November 1996. The JSF program was created to replace various aircraft while keeping development, production, and operating costs down. This was pursued by building three variants of one aircraft, with the initial goal of the variants sharing over 70% of their parts.[3] The first is the F-35A, a conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant. It is the smallest and lightest version, and is intended primarily to replace the U.S. Air Force's aging F-16 Fighting Falcons and A-10 Thunderbolt IIs. This is the only version with an internal gun, the GAU-22. The F-35B is the short-takeoff and vertical-landing (STOVL) variant due to replace the U.S. Marine Corps AV-8 Harrier IIs and F/A-18 Hornets, and Royal Air Force/Royal Navy Harrier GR7/GR9s beginning in 2015. The Royal Navy will use this to replace its Harrier GR7s and the RAF replace its Harrier GR9s. The U.S. Marine Corps will use the F-35B to replace both its AV-8B Harrier IIs and F/A-18 Hornets with a design similar in size to the Air Force F-35A, trading fuel volume for vertical flight systems. Like the Harrier, guns will be carried in a pod. Vertical flight is by far the riskiest, and in the end, a decisive factor in design. Lastly, the F-35C, a carrier-based (CV) variant, will replace the \"legacy\" F/A-18 Hornets and serve as a stealthy complement to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. It will have a larger, folding wing and larger control surfaces for improved low-speed control, and stronger landing gear for the stresses of carrier landings. The larger wing area provides increased range and payload, achieving much the same goal as the much heavier Super Hornet. The U.S. Navy initially planned to purchase 480 JSF; this number was eventually revised to 260 aircraft, with an additional 80 for the U.S. Marine Corps. The primary customers and financial backers are the United States and the United Kingdom. Eight other nations are also funding the aircraft's development. Total program development costs, less procurement, are estimated at over US$40 billion, of which the bulk has been underwritten by the United States. Production costs are estimated at US$102 million per unit for 2,400 units.[4] There are three levels of international participation. The United Kingdom is the sole 'Level 1' partner, contributing slightly over US$2 billion, about 10% of the development costs. Level 2 partners are Italy, which is contributing US$1 billion, and the Netherlands, US$800 million. At Level 3 are Canada, US$440 million; Turkey, US$175 million; Australia, US$144 million; Norway, US$122 million; and Denmark, US$110 million. The levels generally reflect the financial stake in the program, the amount of technology transfer and subcontracts open for bid by national companies, and the priority order in which countries can obtain production aircraft. Israel and Singapore have also joined as Security Cooperative Participants.[5] Due to delays in development and testing, the introduction date of the F-35 was gradually pushed from 2010 to 2015.[6][7] Elements of the X-35 design were pioneered by the F-22 Raptor, and portions of the VTOL exhaust duct design were previously used by the Convair Model 200, a 1972 supersonic VTOL fighter requirement for the Sea Control Ship; in particular, the three-bearing swivel nozzle used in the X-35B was pioneered by the Convair design.[8][9] Additionally, Lockheed purchased technical data from the canceled Yakovlev Yak-141 in 1991 for examination and analysis of its swivel nozzle.[N 1][11][12][13] Although helmet-mounted display systems have already been integrated into some fourth-generation fighters such as the JAS 39 Gripen, the F-35 will be the first modern combat aircraft in which helmet-mounted displays will replace a head-up display altogether.[14] During concept definition, two demonstrator airframes for each contractor team would be flight-tested. Lockheed Martin's[N 2] demonstrator aircraft consisted of the X-35A (which was later converted into the X-35B), and the larger-winged X-35C.[15] Both the X-32 and X-35 power plants were derived from Pratt & Whitney's F119, with the STOVL variant of the latter incorporating a Rolls-Royce Lift Fan module. Because these were proof of concept demonstrators for STOVL risk reduction, the demonstrator aircraft did not need to have the internal structure or most subsystems of the final aircraft as a weapon system.[16] Instead of lift engines or using a direct lift engine like the Rolls-Royce Pegasus in the Harrier jump jets, the X-35B was powered by the F119-PW-611 which used the new shaft-driven lift fan system, patented by Lockheed Martin engineer Paul Bevilaqua, and developed by Rolls-Royce.[17][18] In normal wing-borne flight, the F119-PW-611 was configured as a normal medium-bypass reheated turbofan. The turbofan acted somewhat like a turboshaft engine embedded into the fuselage (but with a much smaller percentage of total heat energy being extracted by the turbine stage).[19] A portion of engine power was extracted via a turbine, and used to drive a shaft running forward via a clutch-and-bevel gearbox to a vertically mounted, contra-rotating lift fan. This was located forward of the main engine in the center of the aircraft (this can also be viewed the same as a high-bypass turbofan but with the low-pressure fan stages mounted remotely from the engine core on an extended, clutched shaft, and creating thrust downwards rather than back around the engine core as in a conventional turbofan).[20] Bypass air from the cruise engine medium-bypass turbofan compressor stages exhausted through a pair of roll-post nozzles in the wings on either side of the fuselage, while the thrust from the lift fan balanced the thrust of the hot core stream exhausting through vectored cruise nozzle at the tail. The X-35B powerplant effectively acted as a flow multiplier, much as a turbofan achieves efficiencies by moving unburned air at a lower velocity, and getting the same effect as the Harrier's huge, but supersonically impractical main fan.[21] Like lift engines, this added machinery was dead weight during flight, but the increased lift thrust enhanced take-off payload by even more. The cool fan also reduced the harmful effects of hot, high-velocity air which could harm runway pavement or an aircraft carrier deck. Though risky and complicated, it was made to work to the satisfaction of DoD officials, and flight testing of the X-35 demonstrators reduced risk to Technology Readiness Level 6.[22] The X-35A first flew on 24 October 2000 and tested air vehicle performance and handling characteristics. After 28 test flights, the aircraft was converted to the X-35B, which added the shaft-drive lift fan, aft swivel nozzle, and roll posts. On 20 July 2001, to demonstrate the X-35's STOVL capability, the X-35B took off in less than 500 feet (150 m), went supersonic, and landed vertically.[23][24][25] The X-35C first flew on 16 December 2000 and tested simulated carrier recovery and power approach.[26] In the fly-off between the X-32 and the X-35, the latter was judged to be the winner. As a result, a contract for System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of the F-35 was awarded on 26 October 2001 to Lockheed Martin.[27] There are a number of differences between the X-35 and F-35, which was designed to be an operational weapon system. The forward fuselage was lengthened by 5 inches (13 cm) to make room for mission avionics, while the horizontal stabilizers were correspondingly moved 2 inches (5.1 cm) aft to retain balance and control. The diverterless supersonic inlet cowl shape changed from a four-sided to a three-sided shape and was moved 30 inches (76 cm) aft. To accommodate weapons bays, the fuselage section was fuller with the top surface raised by 1 inch (2.5 cm) along the centerline. Following the designation of the X-35 prototypes, the three variants were designated F-35A (CTOL), F-35B (STOVL), and F-35C (CV).[28] The X-35A was converted into the X-35B for the STOVL part of the competition. It now resides at the National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, near Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia.[29] Following the end of the competition, the X-35C was transferred to the Patuxent River Naval Air Museum in St. Mary's County, Maryland.[30] Data from Air Force Magazine,[31] Aviation Week & Space Technology,[32][33] Flight International,[34] Aerospace America[35] General characteristics Performance Related development Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_shooting","title":"2003 Lockheed Martin shooting - Wikipedia","content":"Contents 2003 Lockheed Martin shooting Shooting Victims Fatalities Injuries Motive See also Notes References  The Lockheed Martin shooting occurred on July 8, 2003, at a plant in Meridian, Mississippi. The gunman, Douglas Paul Williams, an assembly line worker at the plant, shot 14 of his co-workers with a shotgun, killing six of them,[n 1] before committing suicide. After the shooting, information surfaced depicting Williams' history of making threats and racist comments directed at African-American coworkers. Five of the six killed in the incident were black. The incident was the deadliest workplace shooting in the United States since December 2000, when Michael McDermott killed six co-workers at Edgewater Technology in Wakefield, Massachusetts.[7][8] Given the nature of the attack and Williams' long-known history of racially motivated threatening behavior, the incident was described by some at the time as the worst hate crime against African-Americans since the civil rights movement.[9] On the day of the shooting, Williams attended a mandatory ethics and diversity class together with 13 others. According to some colleagues, Williams arrived at the plant in a very agitated state and made threats to kill other workers. Others, who said they talked to him prior to the shooting, stated that he \"gave no indications that anything was wrong.\"[10] Williams only stayed at the meeting for a few minutes. After having a normal conversation with his colleague Al Collier, who described it as a \"friendly little talk\",[11] Williams suddenly stormed out of the room, saying \"y'all can handle this.\"[10] Telling his supervisor, Jeff McWilliams, that he would take the matters into his own hands, Williams went to retrieve several guns from his pickup truck. He returned to the annex wearing a bandana, and armed with a 12 gauge shotgun, a .223 semiautomatic rifle, and a bandolier with ammunition draped across his chest.[12] At approximately 9:30 a.m., Williams entered the room, yelling \"I told y'all to stop fucking with me! Didn't I tell y'all not to fuck with me?\",[10] and began shooting. He first killed Mickey Fitzgerald, who tried to calm him down, with a shot in the face, before turning his attention towards a group of four workers on the floor. Williams killed Sam Cockrell, who he believed had made complaints about him to the management; he wounded Al Collier, who was shot in the back and right hand. He also wounded Charles Scott, and fatally wounded DeLois Bailey when she tried to flee. Steve Cobb, the plant manager, as well as Brad Bynum, Chuck McReynolds, and Brenda Dubose, whose head and hand were grazed by bullet fragments, were also wounded by ricochet. Williams then went out of the room, but returned after a short while and, searching and calling for Jack Johns, the production manager, continued shooting. Williams eventually left the annex and headed for the main factory, searching for other employees who had reported him to the management for making racist threats. There, he was apprehended by his colleague Pete Threatt, who tried to take away his gun, but Williams pushed him out of the way, lowered the shotgun with the words \"Get out of my way or I'll kill you, too,\"[10] and moved on. While Threatt tried to make the others aware of the gunman, screaming for people to take cover, Williams walked through the plant and shot five other people, most of them at point-blank range. He killed Charles J. Miller, Thomas Willis, and Lynette McCall at their work stations and wounded Henry Odom and Randy Wright, before his girlfriend and co-worker, Shirley J. Price, began pleading with him to stop shooting. Williams then committed suicide in front of her by shooting himself in the torso. His rampage had lasted approximately ten minutes.[9][3][13][10][11] Three more weapons were later found in his car by police: a .22 Magnum Derringer, a .45-caliber Ruger P90 pistol, and a .22-caliber rifle with a scope.[3] Six people were killed in the shooting.[14] They are: After the shooting, plant employees reported to the media that Williams had a history of conflicts with his co-workers and management, with one describing Williams as being \"mad at the world.\"[8] Local law enforcement initially stated that the incident had no clear motive, with Lauderdale County Sheriff Billy Sollie saying, \"There was no indication it involved race or gender as far as his targets were concerned.\"[15] 70% of plant employees were white,[16] and five of the six fatalities in the shooting were African American.[6] In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the President of Lockheed Martin refused to disclose whether company officials were previously aware of any red flags regarding Williams.[3] Further investigations were conducted in the days and months after the shooting. It surfaced that black coworkers of Williams had reported receiving numerous threats and disturbing incidents to management, causing Lockheed Martin to open its own investigation prior to the shooting. In 2001, Thomas Willis reported being intimidated by Williams; an investigator was called in, to whom Willis reported at least three examples of racially motivated death threats.[17] Another black employee, Aaron Hopson, also reported a threat. \"He said, 'You know, one of these days, I'm goin' to come in here and kill me a bunch of niggers and then I'm goin' to kill myself.'\"[9] Williams was ordered to attend diversity and anger management courses; he refused.[17] A month before the shooting, while he was on the factory floor, Williams put a white work bootie on his head in imitation of a Ku Klux Klan hood. Hours later, an assistant plant manager asked him to remove it. Williams refused and demanded to know who had reported him. Told to either remove the hood or leave, Williams left, taking an additional week off work without permission. When he returned, he was again ordered to attend diversity training but not otherwise disciplined.[17][18] Bobby McCall, the husband of one of the victims, told an ABC News reporter, \"He had a list, and he called his list the 'good niggers and the bad niggers.'\" Williams' computer login was later revealed to be \"white power.\"[16] Two years after the shooting, the lawyer representing Thomas Willis' family observed, \"I can't imagine a hate crime that had more forewarning than this one.\"[9]"}

In addition to the standard transport configuration, specialized variants of the C-27J have been developed for maritime patrol, search and rescue, C3 ISR (command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), fire support/ground-attack and electronic warfare missions. In 2007, the C-27J was selected as the Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) for the United States military; these were produced in an international teaming arrangement under which L-3 Communications served as the prime contractor. In 2012, the United States Air Force (USAF) elected to retire the C-27J after only a short service life due to budget cuts; they were later reassigned to the U.S. Coast Guard and United States Special Operations Command. The C-27J has also been ordered by the military air units of Azerbaijan, Australia, Bulgaria, Chad, Greece, Italy, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Zambia.[5] In 1995, Alenia and Lockheed Martin began discussions to improve Alenia's G.222 using C-130J's glass cockpit and a more powerful version of the G.222's T64G engine and three-blade propellers. In 1996, a program began on an improved G.222, named C-27J; it used a U.S. military type designation based on the G.222's C-27A designation. In 1997, Alenia and Lockheed Martin formed Lockheed Martin Alenia Tactical Transport Systems (LMATTS) to develop the C-27J. The design changed to use the C-130J Super Hercules's Rolls-Royce AE 2100 engine and six-blade propeller.[6] Other changes include a fully digital MIL-STD-1553 systems and avionics architecture, and an updated cargo compartment for increased commonality.[7] The C-27J has a 35% increase in range and a 15% faster cruise speed than the G.222.[6] The C-27J first flew on 24 September 1999.[2] Two months later, the Italian air force was reported as the launch customer of the C-27J, ordering 12 Spartans. At the time, the C-27J had a basic price of US$24 million.[8] After over 400 hours of flight tests spanning less than 13 months, the aircraft was granted civil certification by the Italian Civil Aviation Authority at the Paris Air Show in June 2001.[9] Military certification followed on 20 December 2001.[10] By 2005, the U.S. Army had identified the need to replace its aging Short C-23 Sherpa lifter. The Army does not operate many fixed wing aircraft (see also Key West Agreement), but they lost a C-23B in 2001 in which 21 died.[11][12] This was the worst peacetime aviation disaster of the U.S. National Guard.[13] In lieu of adequate fixed-wing airlift availability, the CH-47 helicopter fleet was being worked hard on the \"last tactical mile\" to supply forward-placed troops; thus the U.S. Army sought the C-27J for its direct support capabilities, and to reduce demands on the CH-47 fleet.[14] In 2006, LMATTS was dissolved when Lockheed Martin offered the C-130J in 2006 as a contender in the same U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) competition in which the C-27J was competing.[15] Alenia Aeronautica then paired with L-3 Communications, forming the Global Military Aircraft Systems (GMAS) joint venture to market the C-27J;[16] Boeing also joined GMAS.[17] GMAS bid the C-27J in the JCA competition against Raytheon and EADS North America's C-295 to replace existing Short C-23 Sherpa, Beechcraft C-12 Huron and Fairchild C-26 Metroliners in the Army National Guard, and as a substitute tactical airlifter for Air National Guard groups or wings losing C-130s to retirement or Base Realignment and Closures.[18][19] By November 2006, the C-27J completed the U.S. Department of Defense's Early User Survey evaluations, having flown a total of 26 hours and surpassed all requirements. GMAS also announced that the C-27J will be assembled at a facility at Cecil Field, Duval County, Florida.[20] The JCA's final selection was expected in March 2007, however it was postponed until 13 June 2007, when the Pentagon announced the award of a US$2.04 billion contract for 78 C-27Js, including training and support, to GMAS.[19][21] On 22 June 2007, Raytheon formally protested the JCA contract award for the C-27J.[22] On 27 September 2007, the GAO announced that it had denied Raytheon's protest, thereby allowing the Pentagon to proceed with procurement;[23] at this time, the U.S. Army had requirement for up to 75 aircraft in the Army National Guard; the Air Force had a requirement for up to 70 aircraft in the Air Force Special Operations Command and the Air National Guard.[19] The first C-27J was planned to be delivered to the joint U.S. Army–Air Force test and training program in June 2008.[24] The first flight of a U.S. C-27J occurred on 17 June 2008.[25] As of 2020[update], orders stand at Australia (10), Bulgaria (3), Chad (2), Greece (8), Italy (12), Kenya (3), Lithuania (3), Mexico (4), Morocco (4), Peru (4), Romania (7), Slovakia (2), Zambia (2), United States (21), and an undisclosed country (2).[26][27][28][29][30][31][32][5] In November 2020, Leonardo launched the C-27J Next Generation programme with new equipment, systems and aerodynamic solutions to improve operating efficiency and enhance performance. The New Generation features comprehensive new avionics to comply with the Performance Based Navigation international standard to operate in civil air space without limitations and to enhance interoperability in tactical scenarios, while new winglets contribute to improved climb performance and increase the MTOW by up to 1,000 kg.[5] The United States received its first C-27J on 25 September 2008.[33] In September 2008, L-3 Link's C-27J schoolhouse officially began classes at the Georgia Army National Guard Flight Facility, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. By April 2009, the U.S. Army had accepted deliveries of 2 aircraft and had 11 more on order.[34] In May 2009, the U.S. Army and Army National Guard relinquished all aircraft to the U.S. Air Force, primarily the Air National Guard; this led to the purchase being reduced to 38 C-27Js and the USAF receiving total control of all US C-27Js.[29][35] Initially, the C-27J was to be operated by the Air National Guard for direct support of the United States Army; later, both Army National Guard and Air National Guard flight crews support the aircraft's fielding. By July 2010, the U.S. Air National Guard had received four C-27Js for testing and training, with initial operational capability expected in October 2010.[36] The U.S. Air Force performed the C-27J's first combat deployment in summer 2011.[37] In August 2011, two C-27Js flown by Air National Guard aircrews, augmented with Army National Guard personnel, began operations at Kandahar Air Field, Afghanistan.[38][39] Between August 2011 and June 2012, the C-27Js of the 179th Airlift Wing, followed by the 175th Wing, executed more than 3200 missions transporting over 25,000 passengers, and 1400 tons of cargo.[14] Via tactical control of the C-27Js, the U.S. Army was able to employ helicopters more efficiently, splitting missions between the two platforms based on their relative strengths.[40] On 26 January 2012, the Department of Defense announced plans to retire all 38 USAF C-27Js on order because of excess intra-theater airlift capacity and budgetary pressures;[41] the C-130 would perform its functions.[42] In February 2012, Alenia warned that it would not provide support for C-27Js resold by the U.S. to international customers in competition with future orders.[43] On 23 March 2012, the USAF announced the C-27J's retirement in fiscal year 2013 after determining other programs' budgetary needs and requirement changes for a new Pacific strategy.[44][45] The cut was opposed by the Air National Guard and by various legislators.[46] In July 2012, the USAF briefly suspended flight operations following a flight control system failure.[47] By 2013, newly built C-27Js were being sent directly to the Davis–Monthan Air Force Base boneyard.[48] The USAF spent $567 million on 21 C-27Js since 2007, with 16 delivered by the end of September 2013; 12 had been taken out of service while a further 5 were to be built by April 2014 as they were too near completion to be worth cancelling. Budget cuts motivated the divestiture; a C-27J allegedly costs $308 million over its lifespan in comparison with a C-130's $213 million 25-year lifespan cost.[49] In November 2012, the C-27J deployed for its first domestic mission, contributing to the Hurricane Sandy relief effort.[50] The C-27J had a flyaway cost of US$31.7M in 2012,[51] and an average cost of US$66.2M in 2018.[52] In July 2013, the United States Coast Guard considered acquiring up to 14 of the 21 retired C-27Js and converting them for search-and-rescue missions, while cancelling undelivered orders for the HC-144 Ocean Sentry to save $500–$800 million. EADS claimed that the HC-144 costs half as much as the C-27J to maintain and operate. The U.S. Forest Service also wanted 7 C-27Js for aerial firefighting.[53] The U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) were interested in acquiring ex-USAF C-27Js. If the DoD determined it could not afford the aircraft, they would go to the Forest Service.[54] In late 2013, SOCOM was allocated 7 C-27Js to replace its CASA 212 (C-41) training aircraft.[55] In December 2013, the 14 remaining C-27Js were transferred to the Coast Guard,[56] with the first HC-27J delivered in Coast Guard colors in April 2016.[57] In October 2006, Italy accepted delivery of the first C-27J of an initial batch of 12 aircraft[58] and in January 2007, the first aircraft was delivered to the 46a Brigata Aerea, in Pisa.[59] The Italian Air Force C-27Js have an inflight refueling system and are fitted with a Defensive Aids Sub System (DASS).[60][61][62] From 12 September 2008 to 27 January 2009, a pair of Italian Air Force C-27Js were deployed to Afghanistan to contribute to NATO in-theatre airlift operations.[63][64] In December 2013, an Italian C-27J was deployed to the Philippines to participate in international humanitarian relief operations in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan.[65] The Italian Air Force is also the launch customer for a special mission variant of the C-27J, named Praetorian in the configuration tailored for ItAF and equipped with ISR equipment and roll-on, roll-off mission systems consoles; Italy is the first European nation to operate such an aircraft.[66] In 2006, Bulgaria had initially ordered five C-27Js to replace its aging fleet of Antonov An-26 aircraft, but reduced its order to three aircraft in 2010 due to funding shortages.[67][68][69] In March 2011, the Bulgarian Air Force received the third and final of the C-27Js ordered; the fleet is employed for military transport missions as well as medical evacuations, special tasks of the Interior Ministry, and participating in international operations such as the rotation of Bulgarian troops in Afghanistan.[70] In 2006, the Romanian government announced the selection of the C-27J, seeking 7 aircraft to be delivered from 2008 to replace Antonov An-24 and Antonov An-26 aircraft, beating the EADS CASA C-295.[71] In February 2007, a legal challenge filed by EADS blocked the Romanian order;[72] the order was allowed to proceed when the Romanian court rejected EADS' complaint in June 2007.[73] On 7 December 2007, a contract for the seven C-27Js was officially signed.[26] On 12 April 2010, the first two C-27s were delivered to the Romanian Air Force.[74] In December 2011, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) issued a Foreign Military Sales request for 10 C-27Js valued at US$950m to replace its retired DHC-4 Caribou fleet.[75][76] Australia had opted for the C-27J over the rival EADS CASA C-295 following a RAAF evaluation, which had noted the C-27J's wider and taller cabin being compatible with the Australian Army's general purpose G-Wagen vehicle,[77] and palletized goods.[78][79] In December 2013, the first Australian C-27J performed its maiden flight.[80] In December 2014, the RAAF began maintenance training on the type; delivery of the first two of the ten C-27Js on order was also formally accepted that month.[81] The last aircraft for the RAAF was delivered in April 2018.[82] On 6 July 2011, the Mexican Air Force signed a $200 million contract for four C-27Js and a multiyear support agreement for the fleet.[83] The first aircraft was received two months later; all four were delivered by the end of 2012.[84] Mexico's C-27Js are based at Santa Lucía Air Force Base Num 1 and operated by 302 Air Squadron alongside a number of C-130 Hercules.[85] In June 2013, the Peruvian Air Force was negotiating to acquire four C-27Js for $200 million; future purchases by Peru may increase the total to 12 Spartans.[86] The C-27J competed against the EADS CASA C-295, Antonov An-70, Antonov An-32, and C-130J.[87] On 25 November 2013, Peru selected the C-27J; two aircraft and associated support were purchased in a 100 million-euro deal.[88] On 27 March 2015, the first C-27J was formally accepted by the Peruvian Air Force; by this point a total of four C-27Js were on order for the service.[89] The fourth aircraft was delivered on 5 December 2017 to Grupo Aéreo N°8.[90] In June 2018, Kenya received an international loan for military aircraft and expansion including three C-27Js.[91] In January 2021, the Slovenian government announced its interest in purchasing one C-27J for the Slovenian Air Force and Air Defence.[92] On 17 November 2021, the Slovenian Ministry of Defense signed a contract for one C-27J to the Slovenian Army;[93] it is to be delivered within one year and equipped with modules for transporting casualties, transporting cargo, and extinguishing forest fires.[94] On 21 August 2009, Taiwan announced that it had entered price negotiations with Alenia Aeronautica for the sale of six C-27Js.[95] In 2010, the Indian Air Force issued a Request for Information (RFI) for 16 medium military transport aircraft; Alenia Aeronautica responded with data on the C-27J.[96] In 2011, Indonesia was considering purchasing several C-27Js.[97] In 2015, Alenia Aermacchi were studying the development of a C-27J maritime patrol variant. Other proposed variants of the platform include a multi-mission C-27J that could be armed with various air-launched weapons and equipped with a maritime surveillance radar; Alenia Aermacchi have promoted this model to the Royal Air Force.[98] In 2016, Leonardo conducted demonstration flights around La Paz at the request of the Bolivian government, which may led to Bolivia purchasing C-27Js.[99] The Ghana Air Force requested four C-27Js via an FMS sale, but the purchase was never completed.[100] In 2007, the C-27J was being considered as a sole-source C$3 billion contract by Canada as a replacement for its search and rescue air fleet.[101] Alenia Aermacchi bid their C-27J FWSAR/MPA, a modified C-27J for the Search and rescue and Maritime Patrol Aircraft roles. Exclusive modifications included a mission systems pallet from General Dynamics Mission Systems Canada, additional observation windows, an AESA search radar, satellite and ATC radios, flare/markers launchers, an electro-optical/infrared turret, a new flight management system and other performance upgrades.[102] Alenia Aermacchi bid up to 32 aircraft with lifetime maintenance from KF Aerospace and in-service support from General Dynamics Canada.[103] The C-27J FWSAR/MPA bid competed against the Airbus C-295 FWSAR and the Embraer KC-390. In December 2016, the Canadian government selected the C-295.[104] In 2012, the C-27J was shortlisted as a candidate for the Philippine Air Force (PAF) medium lift aircraft program. A joint team from the Philippines' Department of National Defense (DND) and PAF inspected the C-27J in January 2012.[105] The DND already received approval from the Philippine president to purchase 3 units, and is awaiting congressional approval as of November 2012.[106] However, the PAF announced EADS-CASA's (now Airbus) C-295M as declared winner for the medium lift aircraft acquisition project. The AC-27J was a proposed gunship for the U.S. Air Force. In 2008, US$32 million was reallocated to buy a C-27J for the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command, to fulfill requirements defined by AFSOC for the AC-XX concept, a replacement for the aging Lockheed AC-130s.[107] It was to use proven systems to reduce risk.[107][108][109] AFSOC planned for 16 gunships, the first in 2011 and two more per year up to 2015. The AC-27J was to be a multi-mission platform, equipped with full-motion cameras and outfitted to support covert infiltration and other ground operations, armed with either a 30-millimeter or 40-millimeter gun or precision-guided munitions such as the Viper Strike bomb.[110] At the Air Force Association's 2008 conference, it was named \"Stinger II\" after the AC-119K Stinger.[107][111] C-27A 90-0170 was removed from storage at AMARC in October 2008 and delivered to Eglin AFB, Florida, for use by the Air Force Research Laboratory to test the feasibility of mounting of 30 mm and 40 mm guns. In May 2009, the program was put on hold because U.S. Army funding for 40 C-27s in an Army–Air Force cooperative purchase was removed from the fiscal 2010 budget.[112] U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command elected to standardize their fleet with the C-130 to meet its gunship needs.[113][114] The HC-27J is a modified surveillance variant for the U.S. Coast Guard. Fourteen former U.S. Air Force (Air National Guard) C-27Js are to be modified into HC-27Js for maritime patrol, surveillance, medium-range search and rescue, drug and migrant interdiction, and disaster response missions. Deliveries of the C-27J to the USCG began in November 2014. First flight of a HC-27J occurred in September 2023. The HC-27J is to replace HC-130H Hercules aircraft at USCG air stations. Due to budget constraints, replacement with HC-130J aircraft is not possible.[115] The MC-27J is a variant for multi-mission purposes, including Command and Control, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C3-ISR), Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) and Combat Support operations, using roll-off/roll-on systems for different sensors and equipment: AESA Search Radar; Elettro-Optical/Infra-Red (EO/IR) system; Electronic Support Measures (ESM); palletized Mission System; enhanced Communications System including datalink and SATCOM capabilities; Store Management System to employ Precision Guided Munitions (PGM – one hard point under each wing); palletized fire support system with a high accurate gun able to fire through the LH rear door, that[116] can be installed and rapidly uninstalled when not required. The MC-27J can support special forces and ground troops with direct fire, performing armed ISR, Close Air Support (CAS) and Combat Search And Rescue (CSAR).[116] It also has a defensive aids suite.[117] In 2012, Alenia Aermacchi stated it would offer an upgrade program to the MC-27J configuration.[118] The MC-27J was developed as an Alenia Aermacchi-Orbital private venture. The Italian Air Force converted three C-27Js into MC-27Js in 2016.[119][120] On 25 March 2014, the first MC-27J, named Praetorian in the configuration tailored for Italian Air Force, performed its maiden flight.[121] In July 2014, the MC-27J reportedly successfully completed the first phase of ground and flight testing with the Italian Air Force.[122] In October 2020, the annual Documento Programmatico Pluriennale (DPP) 2020-2022 of Italian Minister of Defence indicates realization of the MC-27J to support special operations.[123] In 2010, the Italian Air Force announced the development of an electronic warfare package for its C-27 fleet under the jamming and electronic defence instrumentation (Jedi) program. One publicised ability of the aircraft is the disruption of radio communications and, in particular, remote detonators commonly used on improvised explosive devices (IEDs).[124] The EC-27 has been compared to the capabilities of the USAF's Lockheed EC-130H Compass Call.[125] In 2015, it was revealed that an improved Jedi 2 payload was under development to provide increased electronic warfare capabilities.[98] Former operators Data from Alenia Aermacchi,[157] C-27J facts,[158] and Leonardo C-27J brochure[159] General characteristics Performance Related development Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era "}

Orincon was established in 1973 in San Diego by University of California, San Diego professors Dr. Daniel Alspach and Dr. Harold Sorenson, and UC Irvine professor Dr. Jim Meditch. Operations began in 1975 with three government contracts. During the Cold War, Orincon helped design the SOSUS tracker system to follow the Soviet Ballistic Missile Submarine. Convinced of the significance of SOSUS, Alspach wrote, \"I see this as part of the chain that ended the Cold War. The SOSUS was so successful, that the Russians had to spend tremendous amounts of money trying to quiet their subs to avoid detection. At the same time, they spent a great deal trying to counter U.S. President Ronald Reagan's Star Wars technology. This, with the inherent inefficiencies of their socialistic economic system, broke the bank and led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.\" Indeed, Soviet spies John Anthony Walker and Jerry Alfred Whitworth in the U.S. Navy revealed to the Russians that their submarines were noisy, and thus, easily detectable. This knowledge led to the development of \"quieting\" technology that Russia later sold to China. In 1990, Orincon's primary business was antisubmarine warfare; however, the U.S. Navy deprioritized antisubmarine warfare technology spending in anticipation of the end of the Soviet Union. Despite the hardship of transformation in the 1990s, Orincon grew by 25 percent in 1998. In fact, until Lockheed Martin acquired Orincon in June 2003, Orincon experienced growth every year since its inception. Orincon's customers have included, but are not limited to, the United States Navy, Department of Transportation, National Cancer Research Institute, and the Federal Aviation Administration. Orincon developed the Intelligent Vehicle Sensor as part of its Airport Classification and Tracking System (ACATS). From 1990 to 1998, there were five fatal ground collisions on U.S. airport runways, and in 1996, there were 280 near misses. The sensor was installed at Long Beach Airport to track airplanes on the ground to avoid runway incursions."}

LMTSS concentrates on Air Traffic Management and security-centric programs that involve large scale systems integration and transformational solutions. LMTSS is based in Rockville, Maryland, USA, with other major offices in Eagan, Minnesota, USA; Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA and Swanwick, Hampshire, England and with many smaller offices in the United States and Great Britain. LMTSS was preceded by LMATM, which started as a campus of IBM Federal Systems. When the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded the contract of the Advanced Automation System (AAS) to IBM Federal Systems, the work was performed at a newly constructed campus in Rockville, Maryland. Due to AAS's large size, the entire campus became involved in the program. During the program's development, the campus became specialized in air traffic control programs. This would lead the campus to become a division that worked almost exclusively with the FAA and other civil air authorities like the United Kingdom's National Air Traffic Services (NATS). In 1994, IBM was in financial difficulties. This led newly hired CEO Lou Gerstner to raise cash and rid IBM of business that was unprofitable or \"not in the hardware and services paradigm\". IBM Federal Systems was one of the few IBM operating units that was profitable and for which buyers could be found. The unit was sold to Loral Corporation, becoming Loral Federal Systems. In 1996, Lockheed Martin acquired Loral's Federal Systems, defense, and SI business units for $9,100,000. The Federal Systems Rockville campus was merged with other air traffic management businesses within the newly formed Lockheed Martin Federal Systems to become Lockheed Martin Air Traffic Management. During this phase of mergers and acquisitions, the AAS program ran into troubles due to a variety of large scale integration and requirements issues. The program was canceled and restarted twice, first in 1994 and later in 1996. The program was eventually canceled by the FAA at Lockheed Martin's request. Parts of the AAS system were spun off into the much more successful Display System Replacement (DSR) and HOST Replacement programs in 1998 and 1999. LMATM also built the New En Route Centre (NERC) in 1998 and Air Traffic Control centers in Taiwan, Argentina, and South Korea. By the year 2000, the company had become profitable with these and other ATC programs. Between 2000 and 2003, the company was baseline profitable. The company dealt with the loss of the New Scottish Centre (NSC) contract due to NATS and FAA budget cutbacks. Moderate layoffs were made in order to reduce head-count and keep the business unit out of debt. In 2002 and 2003, The newly formed United States Department of Homeland Security started spending billions of dollars on large security-centric programs. Traditional defense and government contractors started compete vigorously for these programs. Lockheed Martin followed suit by reorganizing their Systems Integration business unit. Parts of the company that were not strictly focused on the United States Department of Defense were moved around to units that competed in the private sector or for civilian government programs. The LMATM unit was merged with the security-based groups whose customers were the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Central Intelligence Agency, U.S. and Canadian Census agencies, and other such organizations. The modified company was renamed Lockheed Martin Transportation and Security Solutions. In August 2005, Lockheed Martin TSS was awarded a $212 million contract by the New York State MTA for a security system to protect Mass Transit operations in New York City, to include subways, commuter railroads and bridges and tunnels. In September 2005, Lockheed Martin TSS was awarded a $308 million contract by the National Archives and Records Administration to design and develop the Electronic Records Archives (ERA) program.

The C-130J is a comprehensive update of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, with new engines, flight deck, and other systems. The C-130J is the newest version of the C-130 Hercules, and the only model currently in production. As of March 2022[update], 500 C-130J aircraft have been delivered to 26 operators in 22 countries.[1] On 16 December 1994, Lockheed received the launch order for the J-model from the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force (RAF).[2] The C-130J launch order occurred after a UK government stalemate of several months that concerned whether to buy new transport aircraft from Europe or the United States. It was paired with a commitment to buy 40 to 50 of the proposed European Future Large Aircraft aircraft (FLA, which was later designated as the A400M). The FLA commitment, which reduced the size of the C-130J launch order, was intended to ensure a 20 percent British workshare in the FLA program, and to prevent German industry from threatening British Aerospace's position as the wing manufacturer on the FLA and future Airbus commercial projects.[3][4] The RAF ordered 25 aircraft for a total fixed price of US$1.6 billion (~$2.95 billion in 2024), with first deliveries originally scheduled to begin in November 1996.[5] The promised deliveries of the C-130J allowed the British Ministry of Defence to meet the 1996 deadline for replacing half of the RAF's aging fleet of Hercules aircraft, while the FLA aircraft was not at the time expected to be available until 2003.[6] To speed up the sale of military and commercial versions of the aircraft, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) civil certification was pursued before delivery would happen.[5] Civil certification was not a regulatory requirement and was unneeded for the RAF launch order. However, certification was stipulated in Lockheed Martin's contracts with some subsequent customers, including the United States Air Force (USAF) and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).[7] The program suffered from problems such as software integration glitches that extended the schedule by three months, followed by a nine-month delay caused by undiscovered stall characteristics that required aircraft modification.[5] The stall problem was caused by the additional power of the engines and the increase in propeller blades from 4 to 6, which changed the aerodynamics such that the aircraft had a greater tendency to stall and roll at lower speeds.[8] Lockheed Martin spent five months making 20 unsuccessful attempts at aerodynamic solutions,[9] but the stall problems were so varied that the fixes it tried to make applied only to specific conditions (such as only during power off, or only at full power).[10] Lockheed Martin changed the cockpit to include a stick pusher, which takes control and automatically pushes down the aircraft's nose if the pilot does not respond to stall warnings.[8] The stick pusher was meant to be a temporary addition until Lockheed Martin could find an aerodynamic fix for all of the new stall conditions.[10] In late 1997, the company discovered that directional problems could be caused by ice build-ups.[8] Because the AE 2100 engines were more powerful and fuel-efficient than the Allison T56 engines that they replaced, the engines no longer produced enough bleed air to continuously warm the tail. This situation had been anticipated, but the cyclic system that replaced the old de-icing system was found to be insufficient when the C-130J flew in extreme conditions.[11] This problem forced the company to extend the de-icing system higher and lower on the vertical stabilizer to prevent ice formation, causing another delay of five months. These issues resulted in Lockheed Martin exceeding its initial C-130J development budget of US$300 million.[7] By May 1998, Lockheed had spent over US$900 million (~$1.61 billion in 2024) in development costs for the C-130J.[12] By the end of 1998, the company owed the RAF about US$50 million (~$89.5 million in 2024) in penalties due to the delivery delays.[13] FAA type certification occurred in September 1998 following 4,000 hours of flight testing.[14] Deliveries commenced in 1999 as the Hercules C4 (C-130J-30) and Hercules C5 (C-130J). The standard C-130J had a flyaway cost of US$62 million in 2008.[15] On 23 December 2004, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz approved a program budget decision that ended the procurement of C-130J for the Air Force and completed the remaining KC-130J order for the Marine Corps in 2006, which would save US$5 billion in the Pentagon budget.[16] Deficiencies with the C-130J that were cited to support the decision included being unable to drop heavy equipment, the inability to perform combat search-and-rescue missions, cold-weather performance issues, the risk of paratroopers hitting the fuselage when jumping out of the aircraft, major cost increases, and inadequate radar to fly into hurricanes.[17] U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld reversed this decision on May 10, 2005, after members of Congress stated that the canceling the pre-existing orders of 62 total Air Force aircraft over the following five years would result in about US$2 billion (~$3.08 billion in 2024) in termination costs to the government, which would have exceeded the cost of buying the aircraft.[18] In mid-June 2008, the United States Air Force awarded a $470 million (~$670 million in 2024) contract to Lockheed Martin for six modified KC-130J aircraft for use by the Air Force and Special Operations Command. The contract led to C-130J variants that will replace aging HC-130s and MC-130s.[19] The HC-130J Combat King II personnel recovery aircraft completed developmental testing on 14 March 2011. The final test point was air-to-air refueling, and was the first ever boom refueling of a C-130 where the aircraft's refueling receiver was installed during aircraft production. This test procedure also applied to the MC-130J Combat Shadow II aircraft in production for Air Force Special Operations Command.[20] With the addition of the Marine Corps ISR / Weapon Mission Kit, the KC-130J tanker variant will be able to serve as an overwatch aircraft and can deliver ground support fire in the form of Hellfire or Griffin missiles, precision-guided bombs, and eventually 30mm Mk44 Bushmaster II cannon fire in a later upgrade.[21] This capability, designated as \"Harvest HAWK\" (Hercules Airborne Weapons Kit), can be used in scenarios where precision is not a requisite, such as area denial.[22] The aircraft retains its original capabilities in refueling and transportation. The kit can be removed within a day if necessary.[23] The United States Navy is considering replacing its fleet of E-6B Mercury aircraft with C-130J-30 Hercules aircraft in the Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) survivable nuclear communications role. The U.S. Navy's Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) posted a solicitation for fatigue test aircraft to a government procurement website on 18 December 2020. It is to award Lockheed Martin a contract for three \"stretched\" Hercules in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 for testing and analysis for the TACAMO mission.[24] Externally similar to the classic Hercules in general appearance, the J-model features considerably updated technology. These differences include new Rolls-Royce AE 2100 D3 turboprop engines, Dowty R391 six-bladed composite scimitar propellers that have blade tips swept by 35 degrees,[25] digital avionics (including head-up displays (HUDs) for each pilot), and reduced crew requirements. These changes have improved performance over its C-130E/H predecessors, such as 40% greater range, 21% higher maximum speed, and 41% shorter takeoff distance.[26] Because of the deicing problem discovered late in the certification program, the C-130J includes a black rubber deicing boot at the bottom of the vertical fin, which is another visual difference from previous versions of the Hercules.[27] The J-model is available in a standard-length or stretched -30 variant. As a cargo and airlift aircraft, the C-130J's crew includes two pilots and one loadmaster (no navigator or flight engineer), while specialized USAF variants (e.g., AC-130J, EC-130J, MC-130J, HC-130J, WC-130J) may have larger crews, such as navigators/Combat Systems Officers or other specialized officer and enlisted air crew. The U.S. Marine Corps KC-130J uses a crew chief for expeditionary operations. The C-130J's cargo compartment is approximately 41 feet (12.5 m) long, 9 feet (2.74 m) high, and 10 feet (3.05 m) wide, and loading is from the rear of the fuselage.[28] The aircraft can be configured with the \"enhanced cargo handling system\". The system consists of a computerized loadmaster's station from which the user can remotely control the under-floor winch and configure the flip-floor system to palletized roller or flat-floor cargo handling. Initially developed for the USAF, this system enables rapid role changes to be carried out and so extends the C-130J's time available to complete taskings.[29] In 2010, Elbit Systems was awarded a contract to supply its J-MUSIC Directed Infrared Countermeasure (DIRCM) system for integration on the Italian Air Force's C-130J aircraft. J-MUSIC, part of the MUSIC family, uses fiber-laser technology and a high-speed thermal imaging system to protect against heat-seeking missiles, including shoulder-fired MANPADS. This enhancement significantly improves the self-protection capabilities of the C-130J, especially during operations in high-threat environments.[30] The Super Hercules has been used extensively by the USAF and USMC in Iraq and Afghanistan. Canada has also deployed its CC-130J aircraft to Afghanistan. C-130Js from several countries have been deployed in support of the US Operation Odyssey Dawn and NATO's Operation Unified Protector during the 2011 Libyan civil war. From the first flight on 5 April 1996 to 30 April 2013, 290 C-130J Super Hercules aircraft operated by 13 nations surpassed 1 million flight hours.[31][32] In January 2013, it was reported that some of Canada's CC-130J transports had counterfeit Chinese microchips in their cockpit displays that were made by an American Lockheed contractor L3 Communications. These parts are more likely to fail and result in failures such as blank instrument screens during flight. A 14-month investigation by the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee concluded that counterfeit parts in the Hercules and other American-made military equipment are prone to failure with potentially \"catastrophic consequences.\" The U.S. congressional investigation reported the fake Hercules microchips were originally made by the Korean electronics giant Samsung in the 1990s, and more than a decade later, had been recycled, refurbished and remarked to appear genuine by a different supplier from China.[33] Samsung later stated that \"it is not possible to project the reliability\" of the altered parts. The U.S. investigation reported that the problems on the Hercules first came to light in 2010 when the instrument panel failed on a U.S. Air Force aircraft during active duty.[34] On 20 August 2013, the Indian Air Force performed the highest landing of a C-130J at the Daulat Beg Oldi airstrip in Ladakh at the height of 16,614 ft (5,064 m).[35][36] On 5 August 2024, following protests in Bangladesh, the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina flew in a Bangladesh Air Force C-130J to Delhi, India to seek asylum.[37] In August 2025, the Indian Air Force, from its Northern Secor, deployed five of its Mi-17 helicopters along with a Chinook and C-130J transport aircraft each for the flood relief operations following the Uttarakhand and Kishtwar district flash floods. The C-130J aircraft boarded by an NDRF team reached Jammu to supply rescue materials, supplies and trained personnel. So far, 50 Army personnel, 21 BSF personnel and over 40 civilians have been rescued by the fleet from regions including Akhnoor, Pathankot and Dera Baba Nanak. Additionally, over 750 kg of relief materials were also air dropped into Pathankot as part of the operation. Additional helicopters and transport aircraft also remained on standby to join the operations if deemed necessary.[38] The Modular Airborne FireFighting System (MAFFS) is a self-contained unit used for aerial firefighting that can be loaded onto a C-130 Hercules, which then allows the aircraft to be used as an air tanker against wildfires.[39] This allows the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to use military aircraft from the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve to serve as an emergency backup resource to the civilian air tanker fleet.[39][40] The latest generation MAFFS II system was used for the first time on a fire in July 2010,[41] using the C-130J Super Hercules.[42] The 146th Airlift Wing was the first to transition to the MAFFS II system in 2008, and it remains the only unit flying the new system on the C-130J aircraft.[42] The largest operator of the new model is the U.S. Air Force, which has ordered the aircraft in increasing numbers. Current operators of the C-130J are the USAF (including the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard), United States Marine Corps (being their fourth variant after KC-130F, KC-130R and KC-130T,[citation needed]) United States Coast Guard, Indian Air Force, Royal Canadian Air Force, Royal Australian Air Force, Royal Danish Air Force, Royal Norwegian Air Force, Israeli Air Force, and the Italian Air Force. As of March 2022, a total of 500 units have been produced.[43] The Royal Australian Air Force was the second international customer for the C-130J-30, with an initial order of 12 aircraft.[44] An order for two more aircraft was planned, but was replaced by the purchase of a fifth Boeing C-17 Globemaster III.[45] The Royal Norwegian Air Force ordered four C-130J-30s in 2007 to replace six aging C-130Hs in need of repairs.[46][47] Aircraft were delivered from November 2008[48][49] to 2010.[50] One of these was lost in March 2012. The Canadian Forces signed a US$1.4 billion (~$2 billion in 2024) contract with Lockheed Martin for seventeen new C-130J-30s in January 2008, as part of the procurement process to replace the existing C-130E and H models.[51] The C-130J is officially designated as the CC-130J Hercules in Canadian service.[52] The first C-130J was delivered to CFB Trenton in June 2010.[53] The final C-130J was delivered in May 2012.[54] The Indian Air Force purchased six C-130J-30s in early 2008 at a cost of up to US$1.059 billion[55] for its special operations forces in a package deal with the US government under its Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. India has options to buy six more aircraft. The Indian government decided not to sign the Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA), which resulted in the exclusion of high precision GPS and other sensitive equipment. The IAF added similar equipment produced indigenously to the aircraft after delivery.[56] In October 2011, India announced its intent to exercise the option for the six additional aircraft, following the C-130J's favorable performance in the 2011 Sikkim earthquake relief operations. In July 2012, the U.S. accepted India's request for the six more C-130Js through the FMS program.[57] In December 2013, India's CCS approved the order for six more aircraft.[58] On 5 August 2025, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) accorded the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for the sustenance of the C-17 and C-130J fleets of the Indian Air Force.[59][60] The Iraqi Air Force ordered six C-130J-30s in July 2008.[61][62] Qatar ordered four C-130Js in October 2008, along with spare parts and training for the Qatar Emiri Air Force. The contract is worth a total of US$393.6 million (~$540 million in 2024) and deliveries are scheduled to begin in 2011.[63] The United Arab Emirates Air Force announced an order for 12 C-130J transports at the 2009 International Defence Exhibition (IDEX), with an announced value of US$1.3 billion.[64] The United Arab Emirates requested 12 C-130Js through a Direct Commercial Sale in December 2009, with logistics support, training and related systems to be provided through a Foreign Military Sales program.[65] A contract with Lockheed Martin has not been signed.[66] The Israeli Air Force is seeking to purchase nine C-130J-30s.[67] In April 2010, Israel ordered one C-130J-30 with delivery in 2013, and was in contract talks for two more aircraft in June 2010.[N 1][68] An option for a second C-130J-30 was exercised in April 2011, along with planning and advance long lead procurement of aircraft components to support the third C-130J Israeli aircraft.[69][70] The first Israeli C-130J was delivered in June 2013 and was modified with Israeli-unique systems in the United States[32] prior to its arrival in Israel in April 2014.[71] Israel ordered a fourth C-130J-30 in July 2013.[72] The C-130J's local name is \"Shimshon\". The Kuwait Air Force signed a contract for three KC-130J air refueling tankers in May 2010, with deliveries to begin in late 2013.[73] The KC-130Js will refuel the KAF's F-18s and augment its fleet of three militarized L-100s. Oman increased its C-130J order in August 2010 by adding two C-130Js to the single C-130J-30 ordered in 2009. Deliveries are to be completed by early 2014.[74] The Royal Saudi Air Force has purchased[when?] two KC-130Js to be delivered in 2016.[75] The Mexican Government has requested two C-130J-30s.[76] The Mongolian Air Force is planning to buy three C-130Js.[77][78] In July 2013, the C-130J became part of a competition in the Peruvian Air Force for a medium transport aircraft. The Super Hercules was a candidate along with the EADS CASA C-295, the Alenia C-27J Spartan, the Antonov An-70, and the upgraded Antonov An-32.[79] The Peruvian Air Force selected the C-27J in November 2013.[80] In 2015, the French Air Force ordered four Super Hercules to supplement existing capabilities due to the ongoing problems and delays of the ordered Airbus A400M, through FMS the French got two C-130J in 2017/2018 and two KC-130J in 2018/2019 (helicopter refuelling capability), especially supporting French overseas operations in Africa.[81] In January 2017, German defence minister announced the intention to purchase three C-130J and three KC-130J Hercules to acquire tactical airlift capabilities due to the delayed deliveries of the Airbus A400M.[82] In September 2018, Indonesia's state-owned news agency Antara reported that minister of defence Ryamizard Ryacudu said Indonesia is looking to acquire five C-130J Super Hercules aircraft.[83] In September 2021, it was reported that Indonesia ordered five C-130J-30 aircraft from Lockheed Martin for the Indonesian Air Force in 2019, with the first aircraft already under construction.[84] In 2023, Indonesian Air Force received its first C-130J-30 that arrived at Lanud Halim Perdanakusuma.[85] In June 2019, New Zealand's Minister of Defence Ron Mark identified the C-130J-30 as the preferred replacement for the Royal New Zealand Air Force's five remaining C-130Hs that were planned to be in service until 2023.[86][87] In November 2019, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the potential sale of five C-130Js, 24 engines and related equipment for an estimated cost of US$1.4 billion (~$1.69 billion in 2024).[88] The sale was confirmed in June 2020, with the planes expected to be delivered between 2024 and 2025.[89] The first aircraft was delivered on August 8, 2024 at Lockheed Martin's facility in Marietta, Georgia.[90] In September 2020, Philippine Air Force chief Allen T. Paredes planned to acquire five C-130J-30 aircraft.[91] The quantity was later reduced to two after government funds were prioritized for the COVID-19 pandemic response.[92] In December 2022, the Notice of Award has already been released for the acquisition of three C-130J-30 Super Hercules heavy transport aircraft from Lockheed Martin however no official announcement has been made by both parties including PAF.[93] In October 2023, the DND announced the acquisition of three C-130J-30 with the contract worth ₱22.2 billion, the first C-130J is scheduled to be delivered in July 2026, the second is in October of the same year and the third plane is in January 2027.[94] In January 2022, the United States Department of State announced its approval of Egypt's request to purchase 12 C-130J aircraft with related equipment and notified Congress.[95][96] In 2022, the Swedish Air Force ordered four ex-Italian Air Force C-130J-30s for delivery in 2023 and 2024.[97] This order was reportedly put on hold in 2023 for review.[98] In 2024, the Embraer C-390 was chosen instead.[99] In November 2022, the US agreed to a Foreign Military Sales purchase by Australia of 24 C-130J-30 aircraft, that will effectively double the RAAF fleet after the existing aircraft have been retired.[100] In September 2024, NOAA announced an order for two modified C-130Js to replace its existing WP-3D Orion Hurricane Hunter aircraft.[101] C-130Js have been involved in the following notable accidents: Data from USAF C-130 Hercules fact sheet,[187] International Directory of Military Aircraft,[188] Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft[26] General characteristics Performance Related development Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists"}

The name is an adaptive acronym, from Cooperative Avionics Test Bed; CATBIRD is Lockheed's ICAO-designated company callsign. The aircraft was modified in order to provide an economic means of developing and flight testing the avionics suite for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.[1] CATBird has a distinctive appearance, with an F-35's nose and a pair of small canards located just aft of the forward entrance doors. Inside, the aircraft is equipped with racks to hold all of F-35's avionics, as well as an F-35 cockpit.[2] The aircraft was modified under contract by BAE Systems Inc. at their facility at the Mojave Spaceport. Work began in December, 2003, and the aircraft began post-modification taxi tests in November 2006. First flight took place on January 23, 2007 at Mojave. After the initial flight test program conducted at Mojave, on March 2, 2007, the aircraft was ferried to Lockheed's Fort Worth facility for Phase 2 of the modification program, which would install the flight test stations and actual avionics and sensor systems to be tested.[3] In 2014 the CATBird's software test station was upgraded by Northrop Grumman with Tech Refresh 2 hardware which gives the CATBird capability to test F-35 Block 3 Software.

It was designed by Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works for the United States Air Force Force Protection Airborne Surveillance System (FPASS) Program on a quick-reaction contract issued late in the winter of 2002, with the first system delivered in the early summer. It was designed quickly, because the program leveraged technology and design studies developed for the MicroStar MAVs. The program was run by Electronic Systems Center. In 2007, the U.S. Air Force FPASS office switched all of their UAV systems over to the RQ-11B Raven.[1] It is made mostly of plastic foam, resembling hobby grade model airplanes, and uses an electric motor driving a pusher propeller as a powerplant, making it very quiet. It is launched with a bungee cord, carries three small CCD cameras, has an endurance of about an hour. It flies mostly under autonomous control, with the operator keeping track of its activity with a laptop computer. The Desert Hawk is also used by the 32nd Regiment Royal Artillery of the British Army as a tactical surveillance system, and has been used in Afghanistan and Mali.[2][3] Desert Hawk has since been replaced with the more capable and rugged Desert Hawk III.

It is a small surveillance drone, which is mainly used by the United Kingdom, but has also been used by the United States for reconnaissance and recovery missions.[1] The Desert Hawk III was created by the Skunk Works team at Lockheed Martin as an update to the original Desert Hawk, which was developed in 2002 with its first actual flight coming in 2003. The original is slightly smaller and heavier than the DHIII, and the DHIII can stay in the air over thirty minutes longer.[2] The Desert Hawk III is made out of a special polypropylene material. Polypropylene is mouldable when heated to a high enough temperature and returns to a solid state when the temperature is lowered back to normal. Polypropylene was chosen because of its flexibility and ability to protect the device with its rugged surface.[3] The DHIII has one electric motor driving the quiet propeller located on the nose of the plane. The motor was chosen to minimize the sound level produced by the vehicle, allowing it to get closer to a subject during missions without being heard.[4][unreliable source?] There are three different intelligence packages used by the DHIII: The DHIII is equipped with the following sensors and cameras: The Ground Control Station (GCS), the Desert Hawk III's remote control system, is a large briefcase that contains all of the tools needed to operate up to four Desert Hawks at once. It is equipped with tracking capabilities, multiple antennas for proper connectivity, and it is operated by a remote control similar to an Xbox 360 Controller. The GCS is portable and weighs 15 pounds (6.8 kg).[2] The GCS programs flight patterns for missions into the DHIII. Then, when the vehicle is in flight, the GCS uses the autopilot function to perform the programmed flights. The autopilot function allows the operator of the DHIII to focus on using the sensors, radars, and cameras to gather the needed information during the mission. However, the operator is in control during launch and landing sequences.[3] The DHIII is a hand-launched aircraft with specific techniques for launching and landing the vehicle.[3] The DHIII is launched manually. After the launch the ground control station takes over with the flight commands.[3] As the DHIII does not have wheels, it does not land like most airplanes do. It is important that the vehicle lands as close to horizontally as possible. To perform a proper skid landing, the operator must take into account, the angle of descent, the wind, and the terrain on which the vehicle is landing. The operator of the DHIII may bring the device around multiple times to make sure the landing goes smoothly. The aircraft is designed to break apart on impact, to dissipate its kinetic energy without causing damage to the components so they can be reused.[3] The first order of Desert Hawk IIIs was made by the British Army in 2006. They were used by the Royal Artillery and the 32nd Regiment in Iraq. In late 2007, the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense signed a contract, worth $4.8 million, with Lockheed Martin for more DHIIIs.[4] In 2013, there was a total 222 Desert Hawk IIIs in service for the British army, which was almost 40% of all drones in service.[5] It was also reported that 412 DHIIIs had crashed, broken down, or been lost behind enemy lines between the years 2008 and 2013.[6] General characteristics Performance"}

The KC-130J is the latest variant operated by the United States Marine Corps (USMC), with 74 delivered out of 83 ordered as of December 31, 2023.[2] It replaced older KC-130F, KC-130R, and KC-130T variants for aerial refueling. USMC reserve unit, VMGR-452 operated 12 KC-130T aircraft until May 2021; this was the last USMC reserve unit that operated the legacy KC-130s, completing the Corps' transition to the more advanced Super Hercules. The KC-130F made its first test flight in January 1960 as the GV-1 under the old Navy designation system. First entering service in 1962, the KC-130F was designed to undertake aerial refueling missions in support of USMC aircraft. It was developed from the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. The newest version, the KC-130J, shares fifty-five percent of the same airframe as preceding models, but has major improvement. It is based on the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules and provides significant increases in operational capability and performance margins over preceding KC-130F/R/T (legacy) aircraft. Additionally, the KC-130J reduces cost of ownership through system reliability and reduced maintenance man-hours per flight hour.[citation needed] The new HC-130J combat rescue tanker and MC-130J special operations tanker are both derived from a KC-130J baseline.[1] Technological development has led to the incorporation of interior/exterior night vision lighting, night vision goggle head-up displays, global positioning system, and jam-resistant radios. Some KC-130s are also equipped with defensive electronic and infrared countermeasures systems.[citation needed] The KC-130 is a multi-role, multi-mission tactical tanker/transport which provides the refueling support required by the USMC for its aircraft. This versatile asset provides in-flight refueling to both tactical aircraft and helicopters within a 500-nautical-mile (930 km) operating radius, as well as rapid ground refueling when required. Additional tasks performed are aerial delivery of troops and cargo, emergency resupply into unimproved landing zones within the objective or battle area, emergency medical evacuation, tactical insertion of combat troops and equipment, and evacuation missions. The KC-130J offers a 27,215 kg (60,000 lb) fuel capacity that it can allocate between its own flight requirements against aerial refueling offload capacity using its wing and external tanks while in the air. When more fuel is needed, an additional 11,064 kg (24,392 lb) of fuel can be offloaded from a specially configured internal fuselage 13,627 L (3,600-gallon) aluminum fuel tank. The system also functions without the fuselage tank, so the cargo compartment can be used for cargo on the same mission, giving the aircraft even greater flexibility. The aircraft is ready to fuel fixed-wing, tilt-rotor, or rotary-wing aircraft using the standard probe and drogue technique. The two wing-mounted hose and drogue refueling pods (made by Sargent Fletcher) can each transfer up to 300 gallons (1,136 L) per minute to two aircraft simultaneously, allowing for rapid cycle times of multiple-receiver aircraft formations, a typical tanker formation of four aircraft in less than 30 minutes. The KC-130J also provides for rapid ground refueling of helicopters, vehicles and fuel caches. The aircraft has a unique propeller feathering feature (known as \"hotel mode\", derived from the term hotel electric power, when a vessel or other means of transport is equipped with a power plant with the sole purpose of generating electric power for lighting, etc., rather than propulsion) which can slow (at 25% rotation speed) the propellers while the turbines continue to run and energize the generator, providing power to the electric fuel pumps. This reduction of the propellers' speed helps to eliminate prop wash behind the KC-130J. This allows ground forces to operate in relative calm while the aircraft offloads up to 2,271 L, 1,823 kg (600 gallons, 4,018 pounds) per minute. The U.S. Marine Corps has chosen the KC-130J to replace its aging KC-130 legacy tanker fleet. The new KC-130J offers increased utility and much needed improvement in mission performance. As a force multiplier, the J-model tanker is capable of refueling both fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft as well as conducting rapid ground refueling. The refueling speed envelope has been widened from 100 to 270 knots (500 km/h) indicated airspeed, offering more capability and flexibility.[citation needed] Offload rates per refueling pod can be up to 300 gallons (1,136 L) per minute simultaneously. The KC-130's offload is significantly greater than previous Hercules tankers. As an example, at 1,000 nautical miles (1,852 km), the fuel offload is well over 45,000 pounds (20,412 kg). With the addition of the Marine Corps's ISR / Weapon Mission Kit, the KC-130J will be able to serve as an overwatch aircraft and can deliver ground support fire in the form of Hellfire or Griffin missiles, precision-guided bombs, and eventually 30mm cannon fire in a later upgrade.[3] This capability, designated as \"Harvest HAWK\" (Hercules Airborne Weapons Kit), can be used in scenarios where precision is not a requisite, such as area denial.[4] The AN/AAQ-30 Target Sight System (TSS) integrates an infrared and television camera, and is mounted under the left wing's external fuel tank. It is the same TSS used on the upgraded AH-1Z Viper attack helicopter.[5] The typical loadout is four Hellfire missiles and 10 Griffin GPS guided missiles.[6] The weapons systems operator uses a Fire Control Console mounted on an HCU-6/E pallet in the KC-130J's cargo compartment.[7] The aircraft retains its original capabilities in refueling and transportation. The entire system can be removed in less than a day if necessary.[8] The USAF MC-130W Dragon Spear program uses a similar concept. The USMC plans to acquire three kits per active-duty KC-130J squadron for a total of nine kits, each costing up to US$22 million.[9] It was first test flown on 29 August 2009 by VX-20, and first deployed in October 2010 with VMGR-352.[8] The KC-130 has supported operations in the Vietnam War, Operation Desert Shield, Operation Desert Storm, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and other USMC operations over the last fifty years. It also participated in the Falklands War for Argentina. VMGR-252, Cherry Point, NC, was the first fleet squadron to transition to the KC-130J. Contrary to most military squadrons when they transition to a new aircraft, VMGR-252 did not \"stand down\" to train and equip for the new airframe. Instead, they continued full-time fleet support with their \"legacy\" Hercs until fully converted to the J model. This trend was continued by squadrons as they transitioned to the KC-130J. In February 2005, VMGR-252 made the first operational combat deployment of the KC-130J when six aircraft were deployed to Al Asad, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During this time VMGR-252 experienced many \"firsts\" with the new J model conducting aerial refueling, delivery of cargo and passengers, the first combat aerial delivery of supplies by any J model user (the USAF subsequently conducted aerial delivery in Afghanistan with their new J models later that year) and battlefield illumination. VMGR-252 maintained the sole KC-130J presence for a year while VMGR-352 took delivery of and transitioned to the J model. The semi-permissive threat environment and the state of the art defensive systems of the J model permitted it to operate over the battlefield, providing fuel for the jets close to the fight, versus the tanker being far behind the lines in relative sanctuary. On more than one occasion VMGR-252 aircraft came under fire from insurgents, as did VMGR-352 aircraft during subsequent deployments to Iraq. In 2006, VMGR-252 and 352 shared a joint detachment in Iraq and this paradigm continued for a number of years. In the summer of 2006, VMGR-252 provided a two KC-130J detachment in support of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (24MEU) to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus during the Lebanon/Israeli conflict that summer. Also during this time VMGR-252 began extensive operational training and tactics development with the new MV-22 Osprey, refining long range tanker procedures with the new tilt-rotor aircraft. In Spring 2008, VMGR-252 again made KC-130J history by providing the KC-130J aircraft detachment to 24MEU as they reestablished the USMC presence in Kandahar, Afghanistan. This deployment experienced numerous great KC-130J successes conducting all manner of expeditionary type missions routinely landing at austere dirt runways, tactical aerial delivery of goods, and the traditional logistic support and refueling missions that are the hallmark of USMC KC-130 support. Though the USMC KC-130Js have left Iraq, a continuing KC-130J presence has now been maintained in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, with aircraft and crews provided by both VMGR-252 and 352 during different periods. In May 2009, the Okinawa-based \"SUMOS\" of VMGR-152 provided two aircraft and crews to support the OEF presence. This was VMGR-152's first operational combat deployment since Vietnam, and they have been maintaining a continuing presence in Afghanistan with VMGR-352/252. USMC KC-130J aircraft from VMGR-252 and 352 have additionally been deployed to Djibouti for operations in the Horn of African supporting counter-terrorist operations in the region. After the 2010 Pakistan floods, KC-130Js from USMC VMGR-352 squadron delivered over 90,000 kg (200,000 lbs) of cargo across Pakistan in support of flood relief efforts.[10] The Harvest Hawk weapons system for USMC KC-130J aircraft began its first deployment during October 2010 in Afghanistan with Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 352 (VMGR-352).[8] Its first weapons engagement was on 4 November supporting the 3rd Battalion 5th Marines in Sangin. One Hellfire missile was fired and five enemy insurgents were killed. The battle damage assessment stated there were no civilian casualties or property damage during the fire fight.[6] A KC-130J from the 26th MEU participated in a pilot rescue during Operation Odyssey Dawn.[11] Operates two KC-130H aircraft acquired from Spain in 2020. The Swedish air force operates 1 KC-130H tanker On 10 July 2017, a Lockheed KC-130T known as \"Yanky 72\" crashed in Leflore County, Mississippi, killing all 16 people on board. On 29 September 2020, a USMC Lockheed KC‑130J Hercules (BuNo 166765, call sign \"Raider 50\") from VMGR-352 \"Raiders\", based at MCAS Miramar, collided mid-air with an F‑35B Lightning II (call sign “Volt 93”) during aerial refueling over Imperial County, California. The F‑35B pilot safely ejected before the jet crashed near Salton City. The KC‑130J lost both right-side engines and sustained significant structural damage. The crew diverted toward Thermal Airport but was unable to reach the runway and conducted a gear-up emergency landing in a nearby field. All eight Marines aboard survived uninjured. The aircrew received the Distinguished Flying Cross for their handling of the incident.[28] Data from Lockheed Martin KC-130J Super Tanker fact sheet[29] General characteristics Performance Related development Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists"}

The first flight of the P-791 took place on 31 January 2006 at the company's flight test facility at United States Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, CA.[1][2] The P-791 has a tri-hull shape, with disk-shaped cushions on the bottom for landing. As a hybrid airship, part of the weight of the craft and its payload are supported by aerostatic (buoyant) lift and the remainder is supported by aerodynamic lift. The combination of aerodynamic and aerostatic lift is an attempt to benefit from both the high speed of aerodynamic craft and the lifting capacity of aerostatic craft.[3] The P-791 was designed as part of the U.S. Army's Long Endurance Multi-intelligence Vehicle (LEMV) program, but lost the program's competition to Northrop Grumman's HAV-3 design. The P-791 was modified to be a civil cargo aircraft under the name SkyTug, with a lift capability of 20 short tons (18,000 kg) and plans to scale larger.[4] In March 2016, Straightline Aviation signed a Letter of intent for 12 LMH1 airships, valued at $480 million.[5] In 2014, Hybrid Enterprises from Atlanta, Georgia entered into an agreement with Lockheed Martin to market and sell the commercial LMH-1 Hybrid Aircraft built by Lockheed, based on the technology demonstrated by the P-791.[6] At the Paris Air Show in June 2015, Lockheed Martin announced that all required FAA certification planning steps were complete, and Hybrid Enterprises was accepting orders.[7] The LMH1 would initially transport 20 tonnes of cargo or 19 passengers, plus 2 crew members, with deliveries beginning in 2018.[8] In September 2016, plans were announced to operate the LMH-1 craft in Alaska.[9] In September 2017 it was announced that the first flight of the LMH-1 was being delayed to 2019.[10] In May 2023, Lockheed Martin announced the transfer of intellectual property and assets related to their airship business, and the LMH-1, to a new company, called AT2 Aerospace, which would continue the development of the LMH-1 as the Z1 hybrid airship.[11] The Lockheed Martin LMZ1M is the follow on to the P-791 test vehicle.[12][13]"}

The X-55 is a one-off aircraft intended to demonstrate the use of advanced composite materials in the fuselage of an otherwise conventional high-wing transport aircraft. There are no plans to place the X-55 into production. Lockheed Martin's design for Advanced Composite Cargo Aircraft (ACCA) was chosen over Aurora Flight Sciences' design based on the Antonov An-72 in 2007.[1] The aircraft is powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW306B turbofans.[2] The X-55 design is based on the existing Fairchild Dornier 328JET. The fuselage of that aircraft, which is constructed of aluminium alloys, was replaced aft of the entrance door with a newly designed fuselage. The new design makes extensive use of advanced composite materials, selected to allow out of autoclave curing at lower temperatures and pressures than previous materials. The new widened fuselage allows the loading of cargo through a rear ramp. The new fuselage section is constructed as a single large component, including the vertical stabilizer. When attached to the existing nose section, the fuselage is 55 feet (16.8 m) long and 9 feet (2.74 m) diameter. The fuselage has upper and lower halves, each with a roughly-oval shape similar to a canoe. The halves are bonded to circular frames. The fuselage section ahead of the entrance door consists of the existing (metal) 328J component, with fasteners used to bring the forward and new aft sections together. As of April 2008, the fuselage was being fabricated. The first flight of the modified aircraft was expected during the winter of 2008/2009.[3] However, due to a \"glitch\" during fabricating the composite fuselage, that schedule slipped.[4] The delay was caused by an unsatisfactory bond of the skin on the lower fuselage, which required a second fuselage to be fabricated. The first flight was completed at Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs facility (Air Force Plant 42) in Palmdale, California on June 2, 2009 by the Air Force Research Laboratory in conjunction with Lockheed Martin.[5] In October 2009, the ACCA demonstrator was designated X-55A by the USAF. Over the course of the program, 15 to 20 flights were expected. Furthermore, it was estimated that the vehicle was built for half the cost of a conventional design for a similar aircraft.[6][7] As of September 12, 2014, the X-55 aircraft is on display at the Joe Davies Heritage Airpark in Palmdale, California.[8] Related development  Media related to Lockheed Martin X-55 at Wikimedia Commons"}

Designed by Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs, known informally as the Skunk Works,[1] the aircraft was first revealed by Aviation Week,[2] and is intended to research active flutter suppression and gust-load alleviation technologies. The X-56A is based on Lockheed's earlier UAV work, showing influence from the Polecat, Sentinel and DarkStar UAVs. The program calls for the construction of two 7.5 feet (2.3 m)-long fuselages and a wingspan of 27.5 ft,[3] with four sets of wings being constructed for flight testing.[4] The X-56A first flew on 26 July 2013,[5] flying from Edwards Air Force Base; twenty flights were to be flown on behalf of the Air Force Research Laboratory before the aircraft would be handed over to NASA for further testing.[6] The first X-56A unmanned aircraft was severely damaged in a crash shortly after takeoff from the dry lakebed at Edwards AFB, California, on 19 November 2015, on its first flexible-wing flight to test active flutter suppression. The aircraft had previously made 16 flights with stiff wings to prove its operating envelope.[7] The second X-56A unmanned aircraft flew for the first time on 9 April 2015 while under operation by NASA.[8] The aircraft flew eight flights with the stiff wings to clear its operating envelope.[9] The vehicle then completed its first flight with the highly flexible wings on 31 August 2017.[10] One instability mode, body freedom flutter, was shown to be actively suppressed by the digital flight control at 110 kn (200 km/h), within its normal flight envelope. Slender, flexible and lighter low-drag wings would be enabled by flutter suppression.[11] X-56B was destroyed in a crash on 9 July 2021 after suffering an \"anomaly in flight\".[12] Data from [5] General characteristics Performance Related lists"}

After repeated delays, it began flight testing in late October 2025. It is expected to cruise at Mach 1.42 (1,510 km/h; 937 mph) at an altitude of 55,000 ft (16,800 m). It is designed to create only a low 75 effective perceived noise level (EPNdB) thump in order to re-evaluate the viability of supersonic transport, since one of the main reasons previous supersonic transports (e.g. Concorde) were retired was due to their extremely loud supersonic booms. In February 2016, Lockheed Martin was awarded a preliminary design contract, aiming to begin flights in the 2020 timeframe.[2] A 9%-scale model was to be wind tunnel tested from Mach 0.3 to Mach 1.6 between February and April 2017.[3] The preliminary design review was planned to be completed by June 2017.[4] While NASA received three inquiries for its August 2017 request for proposals, Lockheed was the sole bidder.[5] On April 2, 2018, NASA awarded Lockheed Martin a $247.5 million contract to design, build and deliver the Low-Boom X-plane by late 2021. On June 26, 2018, the US Air Force informed NASA it had assigned the demonstrator the designation X-59 QueSST.[6] By October, NASA Langley had completed[clarification needed] three weeks of wind tunnel testing of an 8%-scale model, with high AOAs up to 50° and 88° at very low speed, up from 13° in previous tunnel tests.[7] Testing was for static stability and control, dynamic forced oscillations, as well as laser flow visualization, expanding on previous experimental and computational predictions.[8] From November 5, 2018, NASA was scheduled to begin tests of the effects of supersonic thumps over the course of two weeks to gather feedback. Up to eight thumps a day would be produced at different locations, monitored by 20 noise sensors and described by 400 residents, who would receive a $25 per week compensation. To simulate the thump, an F/A-18 Hornet would dive from 50,000 ft (15,200 m) in order to briefly go supersonic, creating reduced shock waves over Galveston, Texas (an island city), as well as a stronger boom over water.[9] By this stage, Lockheed Martin had begun machining the first parts in Palmdale, California.[10] In May 2019, the initial major structural parts were loaded in the tooling assembly.[11] In June, assembly was getting underway.[12] The external vision system (XVS) was flight tested on a King Air at NASA Langley.[13] This is to be followed by high speed wind tunnel tests to verify inlet performance predictions with a 9.5%-scale model at NASA Glenn Research Center.[11] The critical design review was successfully held on September 9–13, before the IRB report to NASA's Integrated Aviation Systems Program by November.[14] After this, 80–90% of the drawings were released to engineering.[11] The wing assembly was to be completed in 2020.[12] In December 2020, construction was halfway completed with the first flight then planned for 2022.[15] After flight-clearance testing at the Armstrong Flight Research Center, an acoustic validation including air-to-air Schlieren imaging backlit by the Sun to confirm the shockwave pattern testing was slated to be done through September 2022.[5][needs update] NASA planned to conduct flight tests over U.S. cities to verify the safety and performance of the X-59's quiet supersonic technologies and evaluate community responses for regulators, which could enable commercial supersonic travel over land.[16][needs update] In 2018, community-response flight tests starting in 2023–2025 were planned to be used for ICAO's Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection meeting (CAEP13) establishing a sonic boom standard.[5] As of 2022, the results of the community overflights were slated to be delivered to the ICAO and the FAA in 2027, allowing for a decision to be made to revise the rules on commercial supersonic travel over land in 2028.[17] NASA reported the installation of the General Electric F414-GE-100 engine on the X-59, which took place at Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works in Palmdale, California early November 2022. The engine is 13 feet (4.0 m) long and produces 22,000 pounds-force (98 kN) of thrust.[18] The X-59's first flight was planned for 2024.[19] Lockheed Martin released a video showing an assembled X-59 rolling out of a hangar on August 4, 2023.[20] The corporation unveiled the X-59 on January 12, 2024.[21][22] In November 2024, the X-59's engine was tested for the first time, with plans for the aircraft's first flight to take place in 2025.[23] Testing of the craft and ground equipment began with a self-powered taxi on July 17, 2025, and a test of the ground instruments using an F-15B on July 25, 2025 with plans to continue ground testing over the following weeks.[24][25] The X-59 took its first flight in the morning of October 28, 2025, from Air Force Plant 42, and landed around an hour later at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards AFB. The aircraft remained subsonic for this initial flight, reportedly reaching 230 mph at an altitude of 12,000 feet.[26] The Low-Boom X-plane is 99.7 ft (30.4 m) long with a 29.5 ft (9.0 m) wingspan for a maximum takeoff weight of 32,300 lb (14,700 kg). Propelled by a General Electric F414 engine, it should reach a maximum speed of Mach 1.5 or 990 mph (1,590 km/h), and cruise at Mach 1.42 or 940 mph (1,510 km/h) at 55,000 ft (16,800 m).[27] The cockpit, ejection seat and canopy come from a Northrop T-38 and the landing gear from an F-16.[5] With afterburner, its engine will provide 22,000 lbf (98 kN) of thrust.[28] As of 2017, the ground noise was expected to be around 60 dB(A), about 1/1000 as loud as current supersonic aircraft. This was to be achieved by using a long, narrow airframe and canards to keep the shock waves from coalescing.[4] A 2018 projection revised this figure, estimating that the aircraft would create a 75 EPNdB thump on ground, as loud as closing a car door, which would be around 16 times quieter than the 105-110 EPNdB boom made by Concorde (as decibels is a logarithmic scale).[5][29] The central engine has a top-mounted intake for low boom, but inlet flow distortion due to vortices is a concern.[11] The flush cockpit means that the long and pointed nose-cone will obstruct all forward vision. The X-59 uses an enhanced flight vision system (EVS), consisting of a forward 4K camera with a 33° by 19° angle of view, which compensates for the lack of forward visibility.[5][30] In January 2019, RTX Corporation subsidiary Collins Aerospace was selected to supply its Pro Line Fusion Cockpit avionics, displaying[clarification needed] the boom on the ground, and EVS with long-wave infrared sensors.[31] The Collins EVS-3600 multispectral imaging system, beneath the nose, is used for landing, while the NASA external vision system (XVS), in front of the cockpit, gives a forward view.[11] Related lists"}

It is used as the foundation for telecommunications payloads in geosynchronous orbit, as well as GOES-R weather satellites and GPS Block III satellites. Over 40 satellites use the A2100 bus.[1][2] The first satellite, AMC-1, was launched September 8, 1996, and has achieved 15-year on-orbit service life.[3][4] Since 1996 there have been over 45 of the A2100 based satellites launched, with over 400 years of total on-orbit service.[5] Other A2100 spacecraft include JCSAT-13 and VINASAT-2, which were launched May, 2012 on an Ariane 5 rocket,[6] as well as Arabsat-6A and Hellas Sat 4/SaudiGeoSat-1 of Saudi Arabia's Arabsat-6G program.[7] In 2002, Lockheed Martin Commercial Space Systems was given a Frost and Sullivan Satellite Reliability Award for excellence in the production of flexible and reliable communications satellites used in geosynchronous Earth orbit.[8] A2100 customers includes communications companies around the world, including Astra, Telesat, SKY Perfect JSAT Group and others. The Lockheed Martin A2100 geosynchronous spacecraft series is designed for a variety of telecommunications needs including Ka band broadband and broadcast services, fixed satellite services in C-band and Ku band payload configurations, high-power direct broadcast services using the Ku band frequency spectrum, and mobile satellite services using UHF, L-band and S-band payloads.[9] The A2100 satellite system was developed by the Astro Space team at its East Windsor, New Jersey facility, with team members delivering a flexible common bus with fewer components, lower spacecraft weight, and reduced customer delivery time.[10] The A2100 is being supplanted by the LM2100, an evolutionary upgrade with several new features. The military version is the LM2100 Combat Bus.[11][12] The attitude control system includes reaction wheels,[13] with momentum desaturation and main motor maneuver attitude control propulsion provided by small monopropellant hydrazine motors. This hydrazine supply is contained in a central propellant tank of 0.90 m diameter and up to 2.00 m length depending on the customer's requirements.[14] This tank's maximum length was later increased to 2.55 m.[15] The liquid apogee engine uses hydrazine fuel from the central tank along with nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer from two flanking tanks of 0.54 m diameter and up to 1.65 m long.[16] Orbit maintenance is performed by the small hydrazine motors and ion thrusters.[5] The maximum propellant supply (with the largest tanks at 95% fill factor) are 1368 kg of hydrazine fuel and 627 kg of nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. According to Moog-ISP, the A2100 platform uses its LEROS bipropellant Liquid Apogee Engine.[17]"}

In 1989, the Boeing 707-based E-6 Mercury replaced the EC-130Q in the \"Take Charge and Move Out\" (TACAMO) role. As the EC-135 was retired, the E-6B Mercury replaced it in the \"Looking Glass\" role, while the E-4 replaced it in the Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) role. The Boeing 707 production line closed following the delivery of the last E-6 Mercury and consequently spare parts for the platform are scarce, and operations have become increasingly expensive. The E-6 Mercury fleet was modernized to the E-6B standard in 1998, but will reach the end of their expected service lives in the 2030s.[citation needed] By 2015, both the Air Force and Navy realized that they had to look ahead to new platforms to manage their nuclear arsenals in combat.[5] Initially, the two services sought a common replacement aircraft for the E-4, E-6, and C-32A aircraft under the moniker NEAT, combining National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC), Executive Airlift, Airborne Command Post (ABNCP), Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO).[6] As the program progressed, the Navy's TACAMO requirements and the Air Force's ABNCP requirements diverged. In December 2020, the US Navy awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin for the purchase of the C-130J-30 Hercules as a testbed for the TACAMO mission.[7] The aircraft selection represents a return to the C-130 platform by the Navy, which used the EC-130Q (an older variant despite the higher letter) for the TACAMO mission from 1963 until 1993.[citation needed] The selection of the C-130 platform, which is much smaller than the E-6, was surprising to some who expected something based on the larger P-8 Poseidon (based on the Boeing 737) or the much larger KC-46 Pegasus (based on the Boeing 767).[8] The Navy determined that the elimination of the ABNCP and \"Looking Glass\" requirements reduces the crew size and endurance requirements, allowing for a much smaller aircraft.[8] Additionally, using a C-130-based platform ensures training and supply chain commonality with other US military C-130 programs.[8] A C-130-based platform can deploy to a much wider range of bases around the world than a larger jet-based platform. With the C-130's reduced runway requirements compared to any of the above jets and design features that emphasize austere and even rough-field capabilities, the E-130J's operations would become less predictable to adversaries.[8] Three pre-production aircraft were purchased in FY2023: one to be used for air vehicle testing, the other two for mission systems testing.[9] In October 2024, the Navy re-designated the E-XX as the E-130J.[2] The Navy envisions purchases of three production aircraft in FY2027 and another six in FY2028.[9] Since the FY2022 NDAA, Congress has appropriated over $400 million in development funds, including $48.6 million for the first contracts in 2022 and $502 million in 2023. The Navy requested substantially less funding in FY2024, asking for $213.7 million.[10] As of the FY2024 funding request, the program is expected to cost $3.125 billion over the period from FY2022 to FY2028.[4] The Navy described the mission of E-130J in their FY2024 budget request:[4] The TACAMO mission provides an airborne capability for survivable, endurable and reliable airborne command, control and communications between the United States (U.S.) National Command Authority (NCA) and the U.S. strategic forces. This mission is critical in the deterrence and management of a nuclear conflict. A dedicated communications platform, TACAMO aircraft feature the ability to communicate on virtually every radio frequency band from very low frequency (VLF) up through advanced extremely high frequency (AEHF) using a variety of modulations, encryptions and networks, minimizing the likelihood an emergency message being jammed by an enemy. The specific model selected, the E-130J, is 15 ft (4.6 m) longer than the base model, providing more space for crew and equipment. Lockheed has presented an artist's conception of the aircraft that shows enlarged and extended landing gear fairings, multiple domes extending from the fuselage, and two wire antennas capable of extending from the rear of the aircraft.[8] Known planned capabilities include nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) hardening and cybersecurity hardening, and an upgrade of the trailing wire communications system fielded on the E-6.[4] This system extends a 5 mi (8.0 km) long wire from the tail of the aircraft to enable VLF communications with submerged submarines.[8] A notable mission change in the transition from the E-6 Mercury to the E-130J is the deletion of the capability to act as the Air Force Airborne Command Post (ABNCP), with the capability to communicate with nuclear bomber fleets and ICBM silos.[11] At one time, the Boeing EC-135C Looking Glass fulfilled the ABNCP mission, but when it was retired by the Air Force in 1998, the E-6 took over. With the Air Force expecting to handle those duties using the planned Survivable Airborne Operations Center aircraft, that capability will no longer be needed aboard the Navy's TACAMO platform.[8] Related development Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era "}
{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_FB-22","title":"Lockheed Martin FB-22 - Wikipedia","content":"Contents Lockheed Martin FB-22 Background Design and development Specifications (FB-22-4, proposed) See also References Notes Citations External links  The Lockheed Martin FB-22 was a proposed supersonic stealth bomber aircraft for the United States Air Force, derived from the F-22 Raptor air superiority fighter. Lockheed Martin proposed its design in the early 2000s with support from certain Air Force leaders as an interim \"regional bomber\" to complement the aging U.S. strategic bomber fleet, whose replacement was planned to enter service after 2037. The FB-22 was to leverage much of the design work and components from the F-22 to reduce development costs. Lockheed Martin suspended work on the concept following the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, which called for a new and much larger strategic Next-Generation Bomber by 2018; this program had morphed into the Long Range Strike Bomber. In March 1999, the Air Force released a Long Range Bombers white paper in response to a Congressional mandate for the service to update its bomber roadmap. The paper stated that the service's current fleet of strategic bombers consisting of the B-52, B-1, and B-2 would be sufficient until around 2037, when they will need to be replaced by a new \"capability\" with an acquisition program starting in 2019.[1][2] However, this target date frustrated members of Congress who hoped to see greater budgetary emphasis on the bomber mission. Furthermore, the subsequent 2001 Department of Defense (DoD) Quadrennial Defense Review identified increasing threats to U.S. power projection, and the Air Force's aging bomber fleet. One of the key threats identified by the review was the increasing prevalence of sophisticated air defense systems which could deny airspace access to any aircraft without stealth capability.[3] In November 2001, the Air Force released an updated white paper on Long Range Strike Aircraft, which acknowledged these challenges and also anticipated a strategic shift from nuclear deterrence to conventional precision bombing and network-centric warfare for global power projection in potentially unexpected conflict zones. Although the updated paper identified the possibility of a replacement \"capability\" entering service in the 2025 to 2030 timeframe, it cautioned that this was not an in-depth or detailed bomber roadmap.[4] Against this backdrop, some Air Force officials began considering an \"interim\" strike capability such as \"regional bombers\" to complement the existing fleet of strategic bombers while the service and the DoD explored ideas and timelines for a longer term replacement program.[5][6][7] In 2001, Lockheed Martin began internal studies on the feasibility of the FB-22 as the company sought to leverage the design and capabilities of the F-22 Raptor, the result of the Advanced Tactical Fighter program. The studies primarily focused on the ability to survive and perform bombing missions (i.e. air interdiction) in contested environments, in both day and night, against increasingly capable air defense systems and adversary fighter aircraft. Furthermore, experience gleaned from Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan also demonstrated the value of a bomber that could reach targets quickly and remain in theatre in the absence of surface-to-air missiles. The F-22, while designed as an air superiority fighter, embodied some degree of air-to-ground attack ability through precision strikes with Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), with further strike capability improvements planned with upgrades. Though initially unsolicited, the studies attracted the attention of several Air Force leaders, including Secretary of the Air Force James Roche in 2002.[8] One primary objective of the internal studies was to exploit and further expand upon the F-22's high speed air-to-ground capability while keeping costs to a minimum. To this end, the company devised several concepts that saw significant structural redesigns with respect to the fuselage and wings, while retaining much of the F-22's mission system avionics. With an early design later designated FB-22-1, Lockheed Martin lengthened and widened the fuselage to increase the internal weapons load; another design, the FB-22-2, had a stretched mid-fuselage for increased main bay capacity and featured an enlarged delta wing with greater leading edge sweep angle while the horizontal tails (stabilators) were removed. However, it was later found that doing so would have incurred a cost penalty of 25–30% in weight, materials and development. Instead, the company subsequently focused on leaving the fuselage intact as much as possible while enlarging the diamond-like delta wing with the same sweep angles as the F-22.[9][10] Several proposals in this vein were investigated. The FB-22-3 used the stock fuselage with enlarged delta wings and no stabilators, while the FB-22-4 was similar to -3 but with maximal wing whose leading edge met with the upper edge of the caret inlet. The FB-22-4's maximal wing, which was around three times that of the F-22, enabled the storage of a much larger quantity of weapons and fuel. In addition, as a stealth bomber, the FB-22 was designed to carry weapons externally while maintaining stealth with the assistance of detachable and faceted pods dubbed \"wing weapons bay\"; previously, an aircraft could only remain stealthy if it carried its weapons internally.[9] Various figures give the payload of the FB-22 to be 30 to 35 Small Diameter Bombs; this is compared to the F-22's payload of eight of such 250-pound (110 kg) weapons. The main weapon bay doors would also be bulged to allow internal carriage of 2,000-pound (910 kg) bombs in the fuselage. By employing the wing weapons bay, the FB-22 was designed to be able to carry bombs up to 5,000 pounds (2,270 kg) in size such as the GBU-37 GPS-Aided Munition (GAM) or two 2,000-pound bombs in tandem. With stealth, the aircraft's maximum combat load was to have been 15,000 pounds (6,800 kg); without stealth, 30,000 pounds (13,600 kg).[8][9] Combat radius was almost tripled from 600 nautical miles (690 mi; 1,100 km) to more than 1,600 nautical miles (1,800 mi; 3,000 km), which could have been extended further by the use of external fuel tanks. This range capability placed the aircraft in the category of a regional bomber, comparable to that of the F-111, as it was intended to replace the F-15E Strike Eagle and take over some of the missions of the B-1 and B-2. With the FB-22's greatly increased range and endurance, Lockheed Martin also extended the forward fuselage by 60 inches (1.5 m) to accommodate a second pilot in order to reduce workload and also act as a weapon systems officer (WSO).[8][11] According to Air Force Magazine, the combination of range and payload of the FB-22 would have given the concept a comparable effectiveness to that of the B-2 armed with 2,000-lb bombs.[6] The design was to still use the Pratt & Whitney F119 engines but modified for more power and optimized for subsonic efficiency rather than supercruise.[N 1] While some FB-22 concepts featured no tailplanes (using research originally under the X-44 MANTA program), most design proposals incorporated twin tailplanes and likely would have fixed axisymmetric engine nozzles as opposed to the rectangular thrust vectoring nozzles on the F-22.[13] Though not designed for supercruise, the FB-22 would be capable of supersonic dash using afterburners. Projected maximum speed varied depending on the variant; faster versions such as the FB-22-2 would have had a top speed of Mach 1.92, while the FB-22-4 with maximal wing area would have topped out at around Mach 1.5.[10] Because the aircraft was to emphasize air-to-ground capability while maintaining stealth characteristics, the FB-22 would have lacked the F-22's dogfighting capability although it could carry AIM-9 Sidewinders and AIM-120 AMRAAMs for self-defense against fighters.[6] One aspect that arose during the early stages of the design process was the consideration that Boeing would be responsible for the final assembly of the aircraft. At the time, Lockheed Martin was making the mid-fuselage at its plant in Fort Worth, Texas, while assembling the F-22 in Marietta, Georgia. However, since Boeing was responsible for the manufacturing of parts of the fuselage and more crucially, the wings—as well as integrating the avionics—it was considered prudent to give final assembly to Boeing in Seattle, Washington.[11] Other than the wings, the aircraft would have retained much of the design of the F-22. This included 80% of the avionics, software, and flight controls. This commonality would have also significantly reduced the costs of software integration.[8] In February 2003, during a session with the House Committee on Armed Services, Air Force Secretary James Roche said that he envisioned a force of 150 FB-22s would equip the service.[14] In 2004, Lockheed Martin officially presented the FB-22 to the Air Force to meet its requirement for a potential strategic bomber as an interim solution to become operational by 2018.[15][16] Because of the work already done on the F-22, the cost of developing the FB-22 was estimated to be as low as 25% of developing a new bomber,[9] with development expected to be US$5–7 billion (2002 dollars, ~$8.31 billion–11.6 billion in 2024), including the airframe development cost of US$1 billion (2003 dollars, ~$1.63 billion in 2024).[11][17] It was later revealed that six different versions of the bomber were submitted, as targets, payload and range had yet to be defined.[9] However, the FB-22 in its planned form was canceled in the wake of the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments as the Department of Defense favored a new strategic bomber with much greater range that would enter service in 2018.[18][19][20] The Air Force would subsequently embark on the Next-Generation Bomber program to fulfill this goal, although the program was later re-scoped and became the Long Range Strike Bomber program resulting in the B-21 Raider.[21][22][23] Data from Lockheed Martin,[24] Aerofax,[13] Air Force Association[9] General characteristics Performance Armament Related development Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists"}

Attitude control would rely purely on 3D thrust vectoring.[1] The aircraft design was derived from the F-22 Raptor and featured a stretched delta wing without tail surfaces.[1] NASA and the U.S. Air Force had begun preliminary work on the aircraft by May 1999. Plans called for MANTA technologies to be demonstrated on either an F-22 Raptor or F-15. An X-44 prototype would begin test flights by fiscal year 2007. NASA planners stated that developing technologies for the X-44 could have application to the F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter programs and commercial supersonic ventures.[2] Initial feasibility work was funded by government and two contractors.[2] NASA approved the program to start in June 1999, giving the aircraft the designation \"X-44A\".[3] Funding for the X-44 ended in 2000.[4] Some of the subsequent FB-22 proposals had considered having no tailplanes and would have continued the research from the MANTA program.[5] Planning documents called for an aircraft that \"leapfrogs state-of-the-art.\" The X-44 was designed by Lockheed Martin to demonstrate the feasibility of an aircraft controlled by vectored thrust alone. The X-44 design had a reduced radar signature (due to lack of tail and vertical stabilizers) and was made more efficient by eliminating the tail and rudder surfaces, and instead using thrust vectors to provide yaw, pitch and roll control.[1] The X-44 MANTA design was based on the F-22. The engine and fuselage would be carried over to the X-44. Major differences included the delta wing shape and tail-less design. Plans called for the elimination of flight control surfaces. Yaw, pitch and roll authority would be accomplished through thrust-vectoring, possibly by modifying the extant 2-D vectoring nozzles of the F-22. These changes would in effect be combining the control and propulsion systems.[2] The X-44 MANTA would have a greater fuel capacity than the F-22, due to its larger delta wing design. The MANTA was designed to have reduced mechanical complexity, increased fuel efficiency and greater agility.[1] Related development "}

The program was named Fightinghawk in recognition of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, which was the source of its new avionics. The Falklands War in 1982 took a heavy toll on the Argentine Air Force, which lost over 60 aircraft.[citation needed] The supply of modern combat aircraft had been restricted since the United States had imposed an arms embargo in 1978 for human rights abuses;[1] there were further restrictions when the United Kingdom also imposed an arms embargo in 1982. The only combat aircraft that the Air Force could obtain were 10 Mirage 5Ps transferred from the Peruvian Air Force, 19 Six-Day War veteran Mirage IIICJs from Israel, and 2 Mirage IIIB trainers from the French Air Force.[citation needed] In 1989, Carlos Menem was elected President of Argentina and quickly established a pro-United States foreign policy which led to the country gaining Major non-NATO ally status.[2] In 1994, the United States made a counteroffer to modernize 36 former US Marine Corps A-4M Skyhawk II in a US$282 million deal that would be carried out by Lockheed Martin and included the privatization of the Fabrica Militar de Aviones (Military Aircraft Factory – FMA), which was renamed Lockheed Martin Aircraft Argentina SA (LMAASA) afterward.[citation needed] In 2010, LMAASA reverted to the Argentine government as Fabrica Argentina de Aviones (FADEA).[3][4] Argentine Air Force technicians chose 32 A-4M (built between 1970/1976)[5][6] and 4 TA-4F[7] airframes from the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona to upgrade. The upgrade plans included:[citation needed] The contract stipulated that eight airframes would be refurbished at Lockheed Martin's plant in Palmdale, California and the rest (27) in Córdoba, Argentina at LMAASA. At least ten TA-4J and A-4M airframes for use as spare parts, eight additional engines, and a new A-4AR simulator were also delivered.[citation needed] The Fightinghawks, having received Air Force serials C-901 to C-936, saw their first group arrive in Argentina on 18 December 1997 and the first \"Argentine\" A-4AR was rolled out on 3 August 1998 at Cordoba. The last one, number 936, was delivered to the Air Force in March 2000. Two aircraft (a one-seat and a two-seat) remained some time in the United States for weapons homologation. All of the A-4ARs were delivered to the 5th Air Brigade (V Brigada Aérea) at Villa Reynolds, San Luis Province, where they replaced two squadrons of Falklands/Malvinas veteran A-4P (locally known as A-4B) and A-4C. They were soon deployed in rotation around the country from Rio Gallegos in the south to Resistencia in the north where they were used to intercept smugglers and drug trafficking airplanes.[citation needed] In November 2005, they were deployed to Tandil airbase to enforce a no-fly zone for the Mar del Plata Summit of the Americas.[citation needed] In July 2006, they were deployed to Cordoba province for the Mercosur's 30th Presidents Summit.[citation needed] In August 2009, they were deployed to Bariloche for the UNASUR Presidents summit. Later that month, they participated at Reconquista, Santa Fe of the Pre-Salitre official video an exercise of preparation for the Salitre IIofficial video of next October in Chile with Chile, Brazil, France and the United States.[8][9] On 1 May 2010, they participated in the Air Fest 2010 show at Morón Airport and Air Base.video On 25 May 2010, three A-4ARs flew over the 9 de Julio Avenue at Buenos Aires as part of the Argentina Bicentennial shows.[10] In August 2010, the aircraft enforced a no-fly zone at San Juan for the Mercosur's Presidents Summit. One month later, they were present at Reconquista, Santa Fe for the ICARO III integration manoeuvers.[11] In January 2016, Argentine Minister of Defence Julio Martinez confirmed that all A-4ARs had been grounded. This was originally due to the expiry of the explosive cartridges in their ejection seats, but additional problems became apparent later on.[12] Only 4-5 were found airworthy with the rest were in storage at Villa Reynolds.[13] In May 2017, several A-4ARs participated in celebrations marking the 2017 anniversary of the May Revolution.[14] By 2020, as few as six of the aircraft were still reported as operational.[15] In March 2024, Argentina signed a letter of intent with Denmark to acquire 24 used F-16 fighter aircraft as likely replacements for its Fightinghawks.[16] Data from FAA Official site and A-4 Skyhawk General characteristics Performance Armament Related development Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists"}

The F-16 variants, along with major modification programs and derivative designs significantly influenced by the F-16, are detailed below. Two single-seat YF-16 prototypes were built for the Light Weight Fighter (LWF) competition. The first YF-16 was rolled out at Fort Worth on 13 December 1973 and accidentally accomplished its first flight on 21 January 1974, followed by its scheduled \"first flight\" on 2 February 1974. The second prototype first flew on 9 March 1974. Both YF-16 prototypes participated in the flyoff against the Northrop YF-17 prototypes, with the F-16 winning the Air Combat Fighter (ACF) competition, as the LWF program had been renamed.[1] In January 1975, the Air Force ordered eight full-scale development (FSD) F-16s – six single-seat F-16A and a pair of two-seat F-16B – for test and evaluation. The first FSD F-16A flew on 8 December 1976 and the first FSD F-16B on 8 August 1977. Over the years, these aircraft have been used as test demonstrators for a variety of research, development and modification study programs.[4] The F-16A (single seat) and F-16B (two seat) were initially equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-66 pulse-doppler radar, Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-200 turbofan, rated at 14,670 lbf (64.9 kN) and 23,830 lbf (106.0 kN) with afterburner. The USAF bought 375 F-16As and 125 F-16Bs, with delivery completed in March 1985. Early blocks (Block 1/5/10) featured relatively minor differences between each. Most were later upgraded to the Block 10 configuration in the early 1980s. There were 94 Block 1, 197 Block 5, and 312 Block 10 aircraft produced. Block 1 is the early production model with the radome painted black. It was discovered that the Block 1 aircraft's black radome became an obvious visual identification cue at long range, so the color of the radome was changed to the low-visibility grey for Block 5 aircraft. During the operation of F-16 Block 1, it was discovered that rainwater could accumulate in certain spots within the fuselage, so drainage holes were drilled in the forward fuselage and tail fin area for Block 5 aircraft. The Soviet Union significantly reduced the export of titanium during the late 1970s, so the manufacturers of the F-16 used aluminum instead wherever practical. New methods were also used: the corrugated aluminum is bolted to the epoxy surface for Block 10 aircraft, replacing the old method of aluminum honeycomb being glued to the epoxy surface used in earlier aircraft. The breakdown is as follows: 90 F-16A Block 1, 4 F-16B Block 1, 100 F-16A Block 5, 97 F-16B Block 5, 300 F-16A Block 10, and 12 F-16B Block 10. It is unclear how many of each type were produced, but these figures are generally reasonable. As mentioned above, 375 A-types and 125 B-types were delivered to the U.S. Air Force, and the remaining aircraft were exported. The first major change in the F-16, the Block 15 aircraft featured larger horizontal stabilators, the addition of two hardpoints to the inlet chin, an improved AN/APG-66(V)2 radar,[citation needed] an extra aerial refueling light located on the vertical stabilizer, and increased capacity for the underwing hardpoints. The Block 15 also gained the Have Quick II secure UHF radio. To counter the additional weight of the new hardpoints, the horizontal stabilizers were enlarged by 30%. Furthermore, the lower UHF/IFF antenna, the lower threat warning antenna, the total air temperature probe and two ambient air sense ports, originally located on the inlet chin, were relocated due to the placement of the new hardpoints. The Block 15 is the most numerous variant of the F-16, with 983 produced. Nine hundred F-16A Block 15s and eighty-three F-16B Block 15s were produced and rolled out, the last of which was delivered to the Royal Thai Air Force in 1996. According to some sources, the F-16A/B variants for the Republic of China Air Force are designated F-16AM Block 20[8] and F-16BM Block 20.[9] Other sources refer to them simply as F-16A/B Block 20 without reference to the \"M\" designation for Mid-Life Update.[10][11][12] Block 20 added some F-16C/D block 50/52 capabilities: improved AN/APG-66(V)3 radar with added CW mode to guide two types of BVR missiles – AIM-7M Sparrow missiles and AIM-120 AMRAAM, carriage of AGM-84 Harpoon missiles, as well as the LANTIRN navigation and targeting pod. The Block 20 computers are significantly improved in comparison to that of the earlier versions that later integrated into post 1997 Block 50/52, and also getting color MFD. The Republic of China (Taiwan) received 150 F-16A/B Block 20 aircraft. Some sources refer to the F-16 Mid-Life Update as Block 20, but the Block 20 designation was specifically used for new-production jets with upgraded jets being referred to as MLU or Block 15 MLU.[13][14][15][16][17] The breakdown is 100 F-16A Block 20 and 50 F-16B Block 20, but 10 A-models have been lost during missions. At one point, 14 aircraft were sent to the US mainland for training. F-16C (single seat) and F-16D (two seat). The final number of aircraft built and used by the US Air Force were 209 F-16C Block 25, 200 F-16C Block 30, 100 F-16C Block 32, 200 F-16C Block 40, 115 F-16C Block 42, 35 F-16D Block 25, 200 F-16D Block 30, 133 F-16D Block 32, 200 F-16D Block 40, and 100 F-16D Block 42. At this stage, the A/B models were retired and either exported, scrapped for parts, or mothballed and sent to storage facilities. Currently, with the introduction of the F-22 stealth fighter and the mass production of the F-35, the C/D models are being rapidly retired, and the current (2024) fleet remaining in the U.S. Air Force and National Guard consists of 123 F-16C Block 25, 200 F-16C Block 30, 100 F-16C Block 32, 200 F-16C Block 40, 115 F-16C Block 42, 37 F-16D Block 40, and 100 F-16D Block 42. The Block 25 F-16C first flew in June 1984 and entered USAF service in September. The aircraft version is fitted with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68 radar and has improved precision night-attack capability. Block 25 introduced a very substantial improvement in cockpit avionics, including improved fire-control and stores management computers, an Up-Front Controls (UFC) integrated data control panel, data-transfer equipment, multifunction displays, radar altimeter, and many other changes. Block 25s were first delivered with the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-200 engine and later upgraded to the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220E. With 209 Block 25 C-models and 35 D-models delivered, today the USAF's Air National Guard and Air Education and Training Command are the only remaining users of this variant. One F-16C, nicknamed the \"Lethal Lady\", had flown over 7,000 hours by April 2008.[18] The 209 F-16C blocks and 35 F-16D blocks that were manufactured were also deployed to the front lines. This was the first block of F-16s affected by the Alternative Fighter Engine project under which aircraft were fitted with the traditional Pratt & Whitney engines or, for the first time, the General Electric F110-GE-100. From this point on, blocks ending in \"0\" (e.g., Block 30) are powered by GE, and blocks ending in \"2\" (e.g., Block 32) are fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines. The first Block 30 F-16 entered service in 1987. Major differences include the carriage of the AGM-45 Shrike, AGM-88 HARM, and the AIM-120 missiles, which entered service in September 1991. From Block 30D, aircraft were fitted with larger engine air intakes (called a Modular Common Inlet Duct) for the increased-thrust GE engine. Since the Block 32 retained the Pratt and Whitney F-100 engine, the smaller (normal shock inlet) was retained for those aircraft. 200 F-16C Block 30, 200 F-16D Block 30, 100 F-16C Block 32, and 133 F-16D Block 32 were built. Of these, only the early Block 30s were exported to six countries. The Block 32H/J aircraft assigned to the USAF Thunderbird flight demonstration squadron were built in 1986 and 1987 and are some of the oldest operational F-16s in the Air Force. The Air National Guard procured many upgrades for their fleet of aging block 32s including the addition of improved inertial guidance systems, improved electronic warfare suite (AN/ALQ-213), and upgrades to carry the Northrop Grumman LITENING targeting pod. The standard Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) was first changed to a ring laser gyro, and later upgraded again to an Embedded GPS/INS (EGI) system which combines a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with an Inertial navigation system (INS). The EGI provided the capability to use Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and other GPS-aided munitions (see Block 50 list below). This capability, in combination with the LITENING targeting pod, greatly enhanced the capabilities of this aircraft. The sum of these modifications to the baseline Block 30 is commonly known as the F-16C++ (pronounced \"plus plus\") version. Entering service in 1988, the Block 40/42 is the improved all-day/all-weather strike variant equipped with LANTIRN pod; also unofficially designated the F-16CG/DG, the night capability gave rise to the name \"Night Falcons\". This block features strengthened undercarriage for LANTIRN pods, an improved radar, and a GPS receiver. From 2002, the Block 40/42 increased the weapon range available to the aircraft including JDAM, AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), Wind-Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD) and the (Enhanced) EGBU-27 Paveway \"bunker-buster\". Also incorporated in this block was the addition of cockpit lighting systems compatible with Aviator's Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) equipment. The USAF's Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) that added the night vision (NVIS)-compatible systems was completed in 2004. 200 F-16C Block 40, 200 F-16D Block 40, 115 F-16C Block 42, and 100 F-16D Block 42 were built. All served with the United States Air Force, but were later exported after being replaced by their successors. Originally deployed with the United States Air Force, they were upgraded and sent to Iraq as they became obsolete. The first Block 50 F-16 was delivered in late 1991; the aircraft is equipped with improved GPS/INS, and can carry an additional selection of advanced missiles on its 9 hardpoints:[19] the AGM-88 HARM missile, JDAM, JSOW and WCMD.[20] Block 50 aircraft are powered by the F110-GE-129 while the Block 52 jets use the F100-PW-229.[citation needed] Iraq was supplied 36 Block 50/52 jets, 24 single-seat and 12 twin-seat, that are also known by the designation F-16IQ.[21] This was an export model and never entered service with the US Air Force; all aircraft were shipped to various countries for delivery upon completion. This variant's main differences are the addition of support for conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), a dorsal spine compartment, the APG-68(V9) radar, an On-Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS), and a JHMCS helmet. Also, the engine difference is the same as the 50/52. Block 50 using F110-GE-129, while Block 52 uses F100-PW-229.[20] The CFTs are mounted above the wing, on both sides of the fuselage and are easily removable. They provide 440 US gallons (1,665 L) or approximately 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg) of additional fuel, allowing increased range or time on station and free up hardpoints for weapons instead of underwing fuel tanks.[22] All two-seat \"Plus\" aircraft have the enlarged avionics dorsal spine compartment which is located behind the cockpit and extends to the tail. It adds 30 cu ft (850 L) to the airframe for more avionics with only small increases in weight and drag.[23] Poland took delivery of its first F-16C Block 52+ aircraft on 15 September 2006. The \"Poland Peace Sky program\" includes 36 F-16Cs and 12 F-16Ds. All 48 aircraft were delivered in 2008.[24] The Hellenic Air Force took delivery of its first F-16C Block 52+ aircraft on 2 May 2003. The Hellenic Air Force is the first Air Force in the world to operate this F-16 type.[25] The total Greek order was 60 F-16C/D.[26] The Israeli F-16I and its Singapore equivalent variant are based on the block 52+ aircraft. In March 2010, it was announced that the Egyptian Air Force would purchase 20 Block 52 aircraft (16 F-16Cs and 4 F-16Ds), the first of which arrived for testing in April 2012.[27] Under the PEACE ONYX III CCIP program, 165 of Turkish Air Force's F-16s have been upgraded to Block 50+ standards by Turkish Aerospace Industries.[28] The Pakistan Air Force bought 12 F-16C and 6 F-16D Block 52+ fighters.[citation needed] F-16E (single seat) and F-16F (two seat). Originally, the single-seat version of the General Dynamics F-16XL was to have been designated F-16E, with the twin-seat variant designated F-16F. This was sidelined by the Air Force's selection of the competing F-15E Strike Eagle in the Enhanced Tactical Fighter fly-off in 1984. The 'Block 60' designation had also previously been set aside in 1989 for the A-16, but this model was dropped.[29] The F-16E/F designation now belongs to a version developed especially for the United Arab Emirates Air Force, and is sometimes unofficially called the \"Desert Falcon\". The Block 60 was designed for the United Arab Emirates Air Force (UAEAF).[30] Based on the F-16C/D Block 50/52, it features improved radar, avionics and conformal fuel tanks. At one time, this version was incorrectly thought to have been designated \"F-16U\". A major difference from previous blocks is the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-80 Active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, which gives the airplane the capability to simultaneously track and destroy ground and air threats. The Block 60's General Electric F110-GE-132 engine is a development of the −129 model and is rated at 32,500 lbf (144 kN). The Electronic Warfare system is supposed to be quite advanced and includes the Northrop Grumman Falcon Edge Integrated Electronic Warfare Suite RWR together with the AN/ALQ-165 Self-Protection Jammer. Falcon Edge, which was developed by Northrop Grumman specifically for the Block 60, is capable of showing not only the bearing of any threat but also the range. The Block 60 allows the carriage of all Block 50/52-compatible weaponry as well as AIM-132 Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) and the AGM-84E Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM). The conformal fuel tanks provide an additional 450 US gallon (2,045 L) of fuel, allowing increased range or time on station. This has the added benefit of freeing up hardpoints for weapons that otherwise would have been occupied by underwing fuel tanks. The Block 60 retains a MIL-STD-1553 data bus to support certain legacy systems, but also features a MIL-STD-1773 fiber-optic data bus which offers a 1,000 times increase in data-handling capability. UAE funded the entire $3 billion Block 60 development costs, and in exchange will receive royalties if any of the Block 60 aircraft are sold to other nations. According to press reports quoted by Flight International, this is \"the first time the US has sold a better aircraft [F-16] overseas than its own forces fly\".[31] Like the F-35, the Block 60 F-16 has a built in FLIR/IRST/laser targeting system rather than using a dedicated pod that would occupy a hardpoint, increase drag and RCS.[32] In 2014 the UAE requested an upgrade to Block 61, along with the purchase of 30 more aircraft at that level. However, the UAE cancelled the order of buying and upgrading the F-16E/F Block 61.[citation needed] On 15 February 2012, Lockheed Martin unveiled a new version of their F-16 at the 2012 Singapore Airshow. The F-16V will feature enhancements including an AN/APG-83 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, an upgraded mission computer and architecture, and improvements to the cockpit – all capabilities identified by the U.S. Air Force and several international customers for future improvements. The new variant is dubbed the \"Viper\", which is intended to better operate with fifth-generation fighters, and should not be confused with Lockheed's F-16IN Block 70/72 \"Super Viper\", which was offered to India for the Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft competition and showcased at the 2009 Aero India Air Show.[33] \"The new F-16V will become the new F-16 baseline,\" said George Standridge, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics' vice president of business development. On 16 October 2015, the F-16V flew for the first time with an APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar AESA, a new Center Pedestal Display, a modernized mission computer, Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System, and many other upgrades. This can be fitted on new production F-16s or retrofitted on existing ones.[34] The first of these were for Republic of China Air Force (Taiwan) F-16A/B Block 20s. The upgrade of its 144 aircraft fleet started in January 2017 and was completed in February of 2024.[35] In 2019, Taiwan and the United States signed an $8 billion deal that would deliver 66 new-build Block 70 aircraft.[36][37] In September 2017, the U.S. Department of State approved a Foreign Military Sale to Bahrain for 19 new-build F-16V and upgrade its 20 existing F-16C/D Block 40 to F-16V standard. In June 2018, Bahrain finalized its order for 16 new-build F-16V.[38] In October 2017, the U.S. approved the sale of 123 upgrade kits to Greece to bring their existing F-16C and D fighters up to the new F-16 Block 72 standard.[39] On 28 April 2018, Greece decided to upgrade 84 aircraft.[40] South Korea also plans to upgrade 134 of its F-16C/D fleet to F-16V standard by November 2025.[41] In April 2018, the U.s. Department of State approved a Foreign Military Sale to Slovakia for 14 new F-16Vs, pending approval from U.S. Congress.[42] The Defence Ministry of Slovakia announced on 11 July 2018 that it intends to purchase 14 F-16 Block 70 aircraft from Lockheed Martin to replace its aging fleet of Mikoyan MiG-29s.[43] The package, which includes armament and training, is worth €1.58 billion ($1.8 billion), and is Slovakia's largest military purchase in modern history. Defence Minister Peter Gajdoš signed the contract with Lockheed Martin representative Ana Wugofski in a press conference at the capital Bratislava on 12 December 2018.[44] after the government approved the purchase.[45][46][47][48] The first completed jet was unveiled by the manufacturer on 7 September 2023,[49] and first two aircraft were delivered to Slovakia on 22 July 2024.[50] In December 2018, Bulgaria chose sixteen F-16 C/D Block 70/72 as replacements for MiG-29s.[51] On 10 July 2019, Bulgaria approved the purchase of eight F-16 C/D Block 70/72 for $1.25 billion (~$1.51 billion in 2024).[52] On 4 November 2022, the Bulgarian parliament approved the purchase of 8 more F-16 C/D Block 70/72 for $1.3 billion.[53] On 27 February 2019, Taiwan requested to buy 66 new F-16 Block 70/72 airframes for an approximate $13 billion (~$15.7 billion in 2024) as replacement for their aging Mirage 2000 and F-5 fighters.[54] On 16 August 2019, the U.S. Department of Statesubmitted the package to Congress,[55] total package worth $8 billion (~$9.65 billion in 2024) for 66 F-16 Block 70 and other spare parts.[56] On 13 December 2019, the US and Taiwan finalized the F-16V order.[57] On 14 August 2020, Taiwan formally signed an agreement to buy 66 F-16V jets built by Lockheed Martin.[58] On 25 March 2019, the U.S. Department of Defense announced approvals for two sets of foreign military sales of F-16V hardware to Morocco; one for upgrading its existing 23 F-16s to the F-16V configuration, valued at $985.2 million; and the second for a batch of 25 new Block 72 airframes, 29 new engines, a package of precision-guided munitions, and training valued at $3.787 billion.[59][60] On 3 March 2020, It was announced that instead of upgrading, Royal Jordanian Air Force is now looking to buy the latest F-16 Block 70/72 model to replace its current fleet of older F-16s. As early as September 2017, the Royal Jordanian Air Force was working with the U.S. Air Force Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), based at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, to begin the Viper Block-70 operational upgrade program. This study is still under way, but it is unclear whether, and when, it will apply where necessary congressional approvals are needed to sell these possibilities to Jordan.[61] On 30 September 2021, Turkey sent a formal request to the United States to purchase 40 new F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft and nearly 80 kits to modernize its F-16C/D fighters to F-16 Block 70/72 variant.[62] Turkey later cancelled the upgrade kits from the deal and decided to modernize F-16s locally. In May 2021, the U.S. Air Force had awarded a $14 billion (~$15.9 billion in 2024) contract to Lockheed Martin to build new 128 Block 70/72 F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets on behalf of Bahrain, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Taiwan, Morocco and Jordan through 2026.[63][64] The F-16 Air Defense Fighter (ADF) was a special variant of the Block 15 optimized for the United States Air National Guard's fighter interception mission. Begun in 1989, 270 airframes were modified. Avionics were upgraded (including the addition of an Identification friend or foe (IFF) interrogator with \"bird-slicing\" IFF antennas), and a spotlight fitted forward and below the cockpit, for night-time identification. This was the only US version equipped with the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile. Beginning in 1994, these aircraft began to be replaced by newer F-16C variants. By 2005, only the 119th Fighter Group \"Happy Hooligans\", North Dakota Air National Guard, was flying this variant,[citation needed] with these last examples retired from the US service by 2007.[a] Beginning in January 1988, all Block 15 F-16A/B were delivered with an Operational Capability Upgrade (OCU). The Block 15 OCU aircraft incorporate the wide-angle HUD that was first introduced on the F-16C/D Block 25, more reliable F100-PW-220 turbofans, updated defensive systems, the ability to fire the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile, and the AGM-119 Penguin Mk.3 anti-shipping missile developed by the Norwegian company Kongsberg, and provisions for the AIM-120 AMRAAM. Many foreign customers, including Thailand,[65] upgraded their aircraft to the F-16A/B Block 15OCU standard.[66] In 1989 a two-year study began regarding possible mid-life upgrades for the USAF's and European Partner Air Forces' (EPAF's) F-16A/Bs. The resulting F-16 Mid-Life Update (MLU) package was designed to upgrade the cockpit and avionics to the equivalent of that on the F-16C/D Block 50/52; add the ability to employ radar-guided air-to-air missiles; and to generally enhance the operational performance and improve the reliability, supportability and maintainability of the aircraft.[67] Key upgrades include a modular mission computer with faster data processing, an advanced IFF system that allows \"BVR weapons delivery in excess of radar limits,\" and an improved radar—the APG-66(V)2A—with increased range and the ability to track and engage more targets.[13][68] Aircraft that received this set of upgrades were designated F-16AM or F-16BM (single-seat or dual-seat respectively).[14][69] Some sources refer to the F-16 MLU as Block 20, but the Block 20 designation was specifically used for new-production jets with upgraded jets being referred to as MLU or, for example, Block 10 MLU.[70][71][72][73][74][75] Development began in May 1991 and continued until 1997; however, the USAF withdrew from the MLU program in 1992, although it did procure the modular mission computer for its Block 50/52 aircraft.[76][77] The first of five prototype conversions flew on 28 April 1995, and the first production kits were delivered in November 1996.[78] The original plans called for the production of 553 kits (110 for Belgium, 63 for Denmark, 172 for the Netherlands, 57 for Norway, and 130 for the USAF). Final orders amounted to 325 kits (72 for Belgium, 61 for Denmark, 136 for the Netherlands, and 56 for Norway). The EPAFs re-designated the F-16A/B aircraft receiving the MLU as F-16AM/BM, respectively. Portugal later joined the program and the first of 20 aircraft was redelivered on 26 June 2003, with another 20 scheduled to go through the update in-country. In recent years, Chile, Jordan, and Pakistan have purchased surplus Dutch and Belgian F-16AM/BM for their air forces.[77] The development of new software and hardware modifications continues under the MLU program. The M3 software tape was installed in parallel with the Falcon STAR structural upgrade to bring the F-16AM/BM up to the standards of the USAF's Common Configuration Implementation Program (CCIP). A total of 296 M3 kits (72 for Belgium, 59 for Denmark, 57 for Norway, and 108 for the Netherlands) were ordered for delivery from 2002 to 2007; installation is anticipated to be completed in 2010. An M4 tape has also been developed that adds the ability to use additional weapons and the Pantera targeting pod; Norway began conducting flying combat operations in Afghanistan with these upgraded aircraft in 2008. An M5 tape enabled employment of a wider array of the latest smart weapons, and was first installed in 2009. In 2015 tape M7 was implemented.[77] Pakistan finished upgrading 41 F-16 Block 15s to Block 15 MLU in 2014 with help of Turkish Aerospace Industries, after signing a contract in 2009.[79][80] Within the Peace Carpathian program, the F-16 aircraft purchased by the Romanian Air Force from Portugal were modernized to the MLU 5.2R standard starting c. 2016. This version includes many features that offer capabilities similar to the Block 50/52 variants.[81] Among the key elements of the upgrade process are: the PW F100-PW-220E engine; standard F-16 C/D Block 50/52 cockpit, compatible with night vision systems; two multifunction displays; modular mission computer; modernized fire control radar; hybrid navigation system; advanced IFF system; electronic warfare management system and Link 16 data transmission system.[82] In addition, the package also included the integration of other devices such as the Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod as well as the JHMCS helmet for the use with the AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM, AIM-9M and AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles.[83] Plans to further upgrade Romanian F-16s to the M.6.5.2 configuration were approved by the US in 2020.[82][84] The U.S. Navy acquired 22 modified Block 30 F-16Cs for use as adversary assets for dissimilar air combat training (DACT); four of these were TF-16N two-seaters. These aircraft were delivered in 1987–1988. Fighter Squadron 126 (VF-126) and the Navy Fighter Weapons School (NFWS) (or \"Top Gun\") operated them at NAS Miramar, California, on the West Coast; East Coast adversary training squadrons were Fighter Squadron 43 (VF-43) at NAS Oceana, Virginia, and Fighter Squadron 45 (VF-45) at NAS Key West, Florida. Each squadron had five F-16N and one TF-16N, with the exception of Top Gun which had six and one, respectively. Due to the high stress of constant combat training, the wings of these aircraft began to crack and the Navy announced their retirement in 1994. By 1995, all but one of these aircraft had been sent to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) for preservation and storage; one F-16N was sent to the National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola, Florida, as a museum article. As adversary aircraft, the Navy's F-16Ns were notable for their colorful appearance. Most Navy F-16N aircraft were painted in a three-tone blue-gray \"ghost\" scheme. Top Gun had some of the more colorful ones: a three-color desert scheme, a light blue one and a green splinter camouflage version with Marine Corps markings. VF-126 also had a unique blue example. In 2002, the Navy began to receive 14 F-16A and B models from the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) that were originally intended for Pakistan before being embargoed. These aircraft (which are not designated F-16N/TF-16N) are operated by the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) / Top Gun for adversary training and like their F-16N predecessors are painted in exotic schemes. An unknown number of Block 50/52 aircraft have been delivered to the USAF modified to perform the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) mission, replacing the F-4G 'Wild Weasel' aircraft; these were unofficially designated F-16CJ/DJ. The first F-16CJ (serial number 91-0360) was delivered on 7 May 1993, with the first Block 52 F-16 ever in the entire Airforce being delivered to the 157th FS in February 1994 due to their new found reputation that was earned after their win in the 1989 Gunsmoke gunnery competition at Nellis AFB (which also earned them the first F-16s ever in service with the U.S. Air National Guard for the same reason).[20][85][86] Capable of launching both the AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) and AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles, the F-16CJ/DJ are equipped with a Lockheed Martin AN/AAS-35V Pave Penny laser spot tracker and the Texas Instruments AN/ASQ-213 HARM Targeting System (HTS), with the HTS pod mounted on the port intake hardpoint in place of the LANTIRN navigation pod. The first combat usage of these pods as well as the Litening II for the F-16 happened with the Block 52 F-16CJs of the 157th FS / South Carolina Air National Guard Squadron aka the \"Swamp Foxes\" during Operation Iraqi Freedom.[87] They are one of the few Air National Guard squadrons to operate the HARM Targeting system equipped F-16CJs and employed these pods against Iraqi IADS (Integrated Air Defense Systems) hard killing the SAMs opposed to just suppressing them.[87] They were the \"first in\" providing SEAD for the first strikes of the war including the famous F-117 Strike on Saddam Hussein. Another first for the F-16 came when the M3.1B software equipped F-16CJs of the 157th FS were the only F-16s in the theater which could independently fulfill the entire Air-to-Air ID matrix to satisfy the rules of engagement to shoot down enemy aircraft.[87] The F-16CJ was also used to conduct air support by the same squadron during Operation Anaconda.[87] In 2005, the Greek government ordered 30 more F-16C/D, 20 single-seat and 10 double-seat. These aircraft are called F-16C/D Block 52+ Advanced, but are known in the Hellenic Air Force as F-16 Block 52M (due to improved computing power for mission computer MMC). The differences between the normal Block 52+ and Block 52+ Advanced are that the Advanced version has a LINK 16 Communications System, more powerful Mission Control Computer, an extra Multi Function Display with a movable map navigation, advanced Debriefing System and the capability of carrying the RECCE Reconnaissance Pod. They also feature major upgrades by Lockheed Martin and Hellenic Aerospace Industry. The first aircraft were delivered to Hellenic Air Force in May 2009 and they are flying with the 335 Squadron \"Tiger\" in Araxos air base. The F-16I is a two-seat variant of the Block 52 developed for the Israeli Defense Force – Air Force (IDF/AF).[88] Israel issued a requirement in September 1997 and selected the F-16 in preference to the F-15I in July 1999. An initial \"Peace Marble V\" contract was signed on 14 January 2000 with a follow-on contract signed on 19 December 2001, for a total procurement of 102 aircraft. The F-16I, which is called Sufa (Storm) by the IDF/AF, first flew on 23 December 2003, and deliveries to the IDF/AF began on 19 February 2004.[89] The F-16I has an estimated unit cost of approximately US$70 million (2006).[90] One major deviation of the F-16I from the Block 52 is that approximately 50% of the avionics were replaced by Israeli-developed avionics, such as the Israeli Aerial Towed Decoy replacing the ALE-50 and autonomous aerial combat maneuvering instrumentation, which enables training exercises to be conducted without dependence on ground instrumentation. Elbit Systems produced the aircraft's helmet-mounted sight, head-up display (HUD), mission and presentation computers, and digital map display. Furthermore, the F-16I can employ Rafael's Python 5 infrared-guided air-to-air missile, and often uses Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI)'s removable conformal fuel tanks (CFT) for extended range. Key American-sourced systems include the F100-PW-229 turbofan engine, which offers commonality with the IDF/AF's F-15Is, and the APG-68(V)9 radar.[91] The A-16 began as a late-1980s GD project to develop a close air support (CAS) version of the basic F-16 by adding armor and strengthening the wings for a heavier weapons load, including a 30 mm cannon and 7.62 mm M134 Minigun gunpods. Two F-16A Block 15 aircraft were modified to this configuration. Envisioned as a successor to the A-10, the type was to have received the 'Block 60' designation; however, the A-16 never went into production due to a 26 November 1990 Congressional directive to the US Air Force mandating that it retain two wings of A-10s.[29] A second outcome of that directive was a decision by the Air Force that, instead of upgrading the A-10, it would seek to retrofit 400 Block 30/32 F-16s as with new equipment to perform both CAS and battlefield air interdiction (BAI) missions. The new systems for this \"F/A-16\" Block 30 included a digital terrain-mapping system[92] and Global Positioning System (GPS) integration for improved navigational and weapons delivery accuracy, as well as an Automatic Target Handoff System (ATHS) to allow direct digital target/mission data exchange between the pilot and ground units. This approach, however, was dropped in January 1992 in favor of equipping Block 40/42 F-16C/Ds with LANTIRN pods.[29] In 1991, 24 F-16A/B Block 10 aircraft belonging to the 174th TFW, a New York Air National Guard unit that had transitioned from the A-10 in 1988, were armed with the 30 mm GAU-13/A four-barrel derivative of the seven-barrel GAU-8/A cannon used by the A-10A. This weapon was carried in a General Electric GPU-5/A Pave Claw gun pod on the centerline station and was supplied with 353 rounds of ammunition. There were also plans to convert F-16Cs to this configuration and to incorporate the A-10s AN/AAS-35V Pave Penny laser spot tracker. The vibration from the gun when firing proved so severe as to make both aiming and flying the aircraft difficult and trials were suspended after two days. Although the 174th's aircraft were employed for CAS during Operation Desert Storm, they did not use the gun pods in action, and the Block 10 F/A-16 was phased out after the war.[29] About two dozen F-16As of the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) were supplied with indigenous Oude Delft Orpheus low-altitude tactical reconnaissance pods transferred from its retiring RF-104G. Designated F-16A(R), the first example flew on 27 January 1983, and they entered service with the RNLAF's 306 Squadron in October 1984. The aircraft were common with the regular F-16s. However they were equipped with an extra panel in the cockpit to control the center line mounted pod. Under the MLU program, a more standardized interface was introduced so every aircraft could be used to operate the Orpheus pod or any other pod with the standardized interface. Beginning in 1995, the Belgian Air Force replaced its own Mirage 5BR reconnaissance aircraft with at least a dozen F-16A(R) equipped with loaned Orpheus pods and Vinten cameras from the Mirages; these were replaced with more capable Per Udsen modular recce pods from 1996 to 1998. The F-16A(R) remained primarily combat aircraft with a secondary reconnaissance role.[93][94][95] The first reconnaissance variant was a USAF F-16D experimentally configured in 1986 with a centerline multi-sensor bathtub-style pod. The USAF decided in 1988 to replace the aging RF-4C Phantom fleet with F-16C Block 30s fitted with the Control Data Corporation's Advanced Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance System (ATARS) centerline pod, which could carry a variety of sensors. Problems with the ATARS program, however, led to the USAF's departure in June 1993. During the mid-1990s, the U.S. Air Force experimented with a series of centerline recce pod designs, beginning with a prototype pod, the Electro-Optical 1 (EO-1) pod. This was followed by four \"Richmond recce pods\", which saw service in the Balkans. The USAF finally settled on what would become the definitive AN/ASD-11 Theater Airborne Reconnaissance System (TARS). The first F-16 flight with a prototype TARS flew on 26 August 1995, and on 27 September 1996 the USAF placed its first production order for the pods. Block 30s and Block 25s of five Air National Guard (ANG) squadrons have received the system since mid-1998. The USAF, however, does not designate them \"RF-16s\".[93][96][97] The designation RF-16A is used by the Royal Danish Air Force. In early 1994, 10 Danish F-16A were redesignated as RF-16A tactical recce aircraft, replacing the RF-35 Drakens withdrawn at the end of 1993. As a temporary measure they were originally fitted with the Drakens' optical cameras and electro-optical (E-O) sensors repackaged in a Per Udsen 'Red Baron' recce pod, which were replaced a few years later by Per Udsen's Modular Reconnaissance Pod (MRP).[93][96] In 1980, General Dynamics, the USAF's F-16 System Program Office (SPO), and the EPG partners initiated a long-term Multinational Staged Improvement Program (MSIP) to evolve new capabilities for the F-16, mitigate risks during technology development, and ensure its currency against a changing threat environment. The F-16 Falcon Century program, a survey and evaluation of new technologies and new capabilities that began in 1982, was also relied upon to identify new concepts for integration onto the F-16 through the MSIP derivative development effort. Altogether, the MSIP process permitted quicker introduction of new capabilities, at lower costs, and with reduced risks compared to traditional stand-alone system enhancement and modernization programs.[98] The first stage, MSIP I, began in February 1980 and it introduced the new technologies that defined the Block 15 aircraft. Fundamentally, MSIP I improvements were focused on reducing the cost of retrofitting future systems. These included structural and wiring provisions for a wide-field-of-view raster HUD; multi-function displays (MFD); advanced fire control computer and central weapons interface unit; integrated Communications/Navigation/Identification (CNI) system; beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missiles, electro-optical and target acquisition pods, and internal electronic countermeasures (ECM) systems; and increased-capacity environmental control and electrical power systems. Delivery of the first USAF MSIP I Block 15 aircraft occurred in November 1981, and work on the first EPG MSIP I aircraft began in May 1982.[85][99] MSIP II began in May 1981, leading to the F-16C/D Block 25/30/32. Block 25 added systems which the MSIP I provisions had enabled. The first MSIP II F-16C Block 25 was delivered in July 1984. Block 30/32 takes advantage of the Alternative Fighter Engine program that offered a choice between two engines for the F-16: the General Electric F110-GE-100 (Block 30) as well as the newly upgraded Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 (Block 32). To take full advantage of the higher-thrust GE engine, a larger, modular air inlet duct was fitted on Block 30s. MSIP II capabilities introduced on the Block 30/32 also included the ability to target multiple aircraft with the AMRAAM; range, resolution, and signal processor improvements to the AN/APG-68 radar; a ring laser gyroscope; ALQ-213 electronic warfare system; added cooling air capacity for the more powerful avionics suite; and employment of the AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles. The first Block 30 was delivered in July 1986.[85][100] MSIP III produced the Block 40/42/50/52. Initiated in June 1985, the first MSIP III Block 40 was delivered in December 1988, and the first Block 50 followed in October 1991. Introduced in the MSIP III Block 40/42 were LANTIRN navigation and targeting pods, along with the related diffractive optics HUD; the increased-reliability APG-68V fire-control radar; an aft-seat HUD monitor in the F-16D; a four-channel digital flight-control system; GPS; advanced EW and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) equipment; and further structural strengthening to counter the aircraft's growing weight. The Block 50/52 received uprated F100-GE-129 and F110-PW-229 engines; an upgraded programmable display generator with digital terrain mapping; an improved APG-68V5 fire-control radar; an automatic target hand-off system; an anti-jam radio; the ALE-47 chaff dispenser; and integration of AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles.[101] Although only three stages had been originally planned, GD proposed an MSIP IV segment (marketed as 'Agile Falcon'), but this was rejected by the Air Force in 1989. However, most of its elements – such as extensive avionics upgrades, color displays, an electronic warfare management system (EWMS), reconnaissance pods, AIM-9X Sidewinder infrared air-to-air missile integration, and helmet-mounted sights – have been introduced since that time.[85][102][103] F-16A/B Blocks 1 and 5 were upgraded to the Block 10 standard under a two-phase program: Pacer Loft I (1982–1983) and Pacer Loft II (1983–1984).[66] Although the F-16 was originally designed with an expected service life of 8,000 flying hours, actual operational usage has proven to be more severe than expected and this has been exacerbated by its growing weight as more systems and structure have been added to the aircraft. As a result, the anticipated average service life of the F-16A/B had fallen to only 5,500 flying hours. Beginning in the early 1990s, the Falcon UP program restored the 8,000-hour capability for the USAF's Block 40/42 aircraft. Pleased with the results, the USAF extended the Falcon UP effort to provide a Service Life Improvement Program (SLIP) for its Block 25 and 30/32 aircraft to ensure 6000 flying hours, and a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for its F-16A/B aircraft to assure their achieving 8,000 hours.[104] Falcon STAR (Structural Augmentation Roadmap) is a program to repair and replace critical airframe components on all F-16A/B/C/D aircraft; like Falcon UP, it is intended to ensure an 8000-hour service life, but it is based on more recent operational usage statistics. The first redelivery occurred in February 2004, and in 2007 the USAF announced that it would upgrade 651 Block 40/42/50/52 F-16s; this is expected to extend the Falcon STAR program, which began in 1999, through 2014.[104] Israel Aircraft Industries developed an open-architecture avionics suite upgrade for its F-16s known as the Avionics Capabilities Enhancement (ACE). It introduced the first \"full-glass cockpit\" on an operational F-16, and featured an advanced fire-control radar, an Up Front Control Panel (UFCP), and an option for a wide-angle HUD or a helmet-mounted display. The first flight of an F-16B equipped with ACE was accomplished in May 2001. The ACE upgrade was not taken up by the Israeli Air Force, which ordered a second batch of the F-16I instead; IAI offered ACE to Venezuela, but the U.S. government blocked it and stated that it would only permit elements of ACE, not the whole suite, to be exported.[105][106] Singapore Technologies Aerospace (ST Aero) has also developed a state-of-the-art, \"glass cockpit\" avionics suite as an alternative to the MLU offering. The Falcon ONE suite includes a wide-angle HUD that can display FLIR imagery, the Striker Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD), a datalink capability, and the FIAR Grifo radar. First revealed at the Farnborough Air Show on 25 July 2000, it has yet to find a customer.[107][108] The Common Configuration Implementation Program (CCIP) was a $2 billion modernization effort that sought to standardize all USAF Block 40/42/50/52 F-16s to a common Block 50/52-based avionics software and hardware configuration for simplified training and maintenance. Lockheed Martin received a contract to develop the first phase CCIP configuration upgrade packages in June 1998; kit production work started in 2000, and deliveries began in July 2001.[109][110] In 2007, Korean Air was awarded a USAF contract for F-16 upgrades, which included both CCIP, Falcon-STAR, and Drop in Maintenance works. 100 USAF F-16s were to be upgraded and maintained by Korean Air under the contract. The upgrade program would extend the F-16's flying hours from 6,000 to 8,000 hours. The work would continue for six years until 2013.[111] Phase 1 of the CCIP added new Modular Mission Computers, color cockpit display kits and advanced IFF systems to domestically based Block 50/52 aircraft, and introduced the new Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). The ability of the F-16CJ/DJ to employ GPS-guided weapons was extended to the rest of the Block 50/52 fleet. Upgraded Phase 1 aircraft redeliveries began in January 2002. The second phase extended these upgrades to overseas-based Block 50/52 Falcons, and redeliveries ran from July 2003 to June 2007. Phase II also included the introduction of autonomous beyond-visual-range air-intercept capability, the Link-16 datalink, and the Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS).[109] The ongoing Phase 3 effort is focused on Block 40/42 F-16s. Development began in July 2003 and by June 2007 Lockheed Martin had completed roughly a quarter of the USAF's Block 40/42 fleet. Phase 3 incorporates the M3+ Operational Flight Program (OFP) which extends the capabilities of the first two phases to the Block 40/42 fleet and adds Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS), the new NATO-standard datalink network. Development of an M4+ OFP began in late 2002; this update will allow use of the Raytheon AIM-9X on Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft. Northrop Grumman was awarded a contract in early 2004 to develop an M5+ upgrade kit to update the AN/APG-68(V)5 radars on the Block 40/42/50/52 Falcons to the AN/APG-68(V)9 standard; upgrading of Block 40/42 aircraft began in 2007 and is to become operational on the Block 50/52 aircraft by 2010. An M6+ OFP is under consideration, and could include integration of the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) on CCIP aircraft, which is planned to begin in fiscal year 2012.[109] Turkey became the first international customer for the CCIP update with the signing of a $1.1 billion contract on 26 April 2005 to upgrade an initial 80 Block 40/50 and 37 Block 30 F-16C/Ds to an equivalent of the Phase 3/M5+ OFP standard under the \"Peace Onyx III\" Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. This work will be performed by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) and Turkey holds the option to upgrade the remainder of its 100 Block 40s, which could extend the program.[109][112] The Combat Upgrade Plan Integration Details (CUPID) effort is an ongoing initiative to bring older U.S. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command Block 25/30/32 F-16s closer to Block 50/52 specifications. CUPID focuses on adding improved precision attack capabilities, night vision equipment, datalinks, carriage of the Litening II infrared targeting pod, and laser- and GPS-guided weapons.[104] In 2011[113] Israeli Air force announced an upgrade program of its aging F-16C/D (blocks 30 and 40) fleet, to make it valuable in 2020 and even later. The upgrade included installation of new avionics and new wiring, which brought these block 30/40 airframes closer to the IAF's I (Sufa) model (itself an upgrade of the Block 52+ F-16D). The program was completed in 2014.[114] In 2012, the Turkish Air Force announced the modernization of 35 of its F-16 Block 30 aircraft. Replacements within the scope of the modernization include: a Turkish mission computer, secure voice radio module, and IFF system; and upgrades to various other instrumentation and avionics systems. In 2023, it was announced that the upgrade will be applied to other F-16 aircraft starting with the Block 40 variants in the Turkish Air Force.[115] The said aircraft will be dubbed as 'F-16C/D Block 30TM'. Another important project carried out with ÖZGÜR is the domestic Active Electronic Phased Array (AESA) radar developed by Aselsan. The radar will first be installed on Baykar's AKINCI UCAV before being tested and integrated on the F-16.[115][116][117] Within the scope of ÖZGÜR II program, modernization will be applied to F-16 Block 40/50 with an additional upgrade to Block 30s which will include obtaining External Load Certification for various ammunition types, miniature bombs, and the ASELPOD targeting pod. The project also aims to incorporate communications and radio equipment and facilitate the integration of Bozdoğan and HGK-82 munitions into the Block 30s.[115] In 2022, the United States Air Force announced the modernization of 608 of its F-16 Block 40 and F-16 Block 50 to F-16 Block 70 (F-16V) standard.[118] Upgrades for the PoBIT program include the installation of the AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), the Center Display Unit (CDU), a programmable data generator, new-generation electronic warfare capabilities, a communications suite upgrade, and a modernized mission computer.[119] The initial YF-16 prototype was reconfigured in December 1975 to serve as the USAF Flight Dynamics Laboratory's Control-Configured Vehicle (CCV) testbed. The CCV concept entails \"decoupling\" the aircraft's flight control surfaces so that they can operate independently. This approach enables unusual maneuvers such as being able to turn the airplane without banking it. The ability to maneuver in one plane without simultaneously moving in another was seen as offering novel tactical performance capabilities for a fighter. The CCV YF-16 design featured twin pivoting ventral fins mounted vertically underneath the air intake, and its triply redundant fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system (FCS) was modified to permit use of flaperons on the wings' trailing edges which would act in combination with an all-moving stabilator. The fuel system was redesigned to enable adjustment of the aircraft's center of gravity by transferring fuel from one tank to another. The CCV aircraft achieved its first flight on 16 March 1976. The flight test program ran until 30 June 1977, and was marred only by a hard landing on 24 June 1976 that delayed testing until repairs were effected. The CCV program was judged successful and led to a more ambitious follow-on effort in the form of the \"Advanced Fighter Technology Integration\" (AFTI) F-16.[97][120][121] The first effort accomplished under the AFTI program was a paper study with three separate contractors (i.e., McDonnell Douglas, Fairchild Republic, Rockwell International) to design an advanced aircraft technology demonstrator using new concepts such as direct lift control, direct side force control and drag modulation.[122] General Dynamics was one of several U.S. aircraft makers awarded a contract by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1976 to develop proposals for an experimental forward-swept wing test aircraft. GD's entry, the Swept Forward Wing (SFW) F-16, had a slightly lengthened fuselage to accommodate the larger, advanced composites wing. In January 1981, DARPA selected Grumman's entry, which became known as the X-29A. Although the SFW F-16 was not chosen, the X-29 incorporated some of the F-16's features, particularly its FBW flight control system and its undercarriage.[123] The F-16XL featured a novel 'cranked-arrow' type of delta wing with more than twice the area of the standard F-16 wing. Developed under a program originally known as the Supersonic Cruise and Maneuvering Program (SCAMP), the design was intended to offer low drag at high subsonic or supersonic speeds without compromising low-speed maneuverability. As a result, the F-16XL was able to cruise efficiently at supersonic speeds without using afterburner, commonly known as supercruise.[124] In late 1980, the USAF agreed to provide GD with the third and fifth FSD F-16s for modification into single-seat and twin-seat F-16XL prototypes. To accommodate the larger wing, the aircraft was lengthened 56 in (142 cm) by the addition of a 30-inch (76 cm) plug in the forward fuselage and a 26-inch (66 cm) section to the aft fuselage just behind the landing gear bulkhead. The rear fuselage was also canted up by three degrees to increase the angle of attack on takeoff and landing. The F-16XL could carry twice the payload of the F-16 on 27 hardpoints, and it had a 40% greater range due to an 82% increase in internal fuel carriage. The single-seat F-16XL first flew on 3 July 1982, followed by the two-seater on 29 October 1982. The F-16XL competed unsuccessfully with the F-15E Strike Eagle in the Enhanced Tactical Fighter (ETF) program; if it had won the competition, the production versions were to have been designated F-16E/F.[125] Following the February 1984 selection announcement, both examples of the F-16XL were placed in flyable storage.[126] In late 1988, the two prototypes were taken out of storage and turned over to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for use in a program designed to evaluate aerodynamic concepts for improving laminar airflow over the wing during sustained supersonic flight. From 1989 to 1999, both aircraft were used by NASA for several experimental research programs, and in 2007, NASA was considering returning the single-seat F-16XL to operational status for further aeronautical research. The F-16 XL had much better lift and maneuverability than the normal F-16 A/B Block15.[126][127] At a Senate executive session 'Air Force Acquisition Plans and Modernization Requirements' held on 22 April 1991, Major General Joseph W. Ralston, USAF Director of Tactical Programs, testified that the Falcon 21++ was supposed to have a new fuselage carrying AIM-120 AMRAAMs inside the fuselage. The Falcon 21++ was studied in 1990 as a cheaper alternative to the Advanced Tactical Fighter that became the F-22 Raptor. A blurry image of poor resolution shows the Falcon 21++ had a delta wing and twin vertical tails. The Falcon 21++ was also supposed to be powered by an ATF engine (P&W F119) and an AESA radar with ATF avionics, plus \"as much observable treatment as could be placed on an airplane like that\", according to Major General Ralston.[128] In 1993 Lockheed proposed development of a new version of the F-16. This F-16X \"Falcon 2000\" featured a delta wing based on that of the F-22, together with a fuselage stretch to accommodate the new wing. The F-16X would have 80% more internal fuel volume. The design also permitted conformal carriage of the AIM-120 AMRAAM. Lockheed claimed the F-16X could be built for two-thirds the cost of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.[85][129] In the late 1980s, General Dynamics and General Electric began exploring the application of thrust vector control (TVC) technology to the F-16 under the F-16 Multi-Axis Thrust-Vectoring (MATV) program. Originally the Israel Defense Forces/Air Force was going to supply an F-16D for this effort; however, the USAF, which had initially declined to support the program, changed its mind and took over the MATV project in 1991 and Israel withdrew from it the following year[130] (the IDF was involved later when Ilan Ramon, who later became an astronaut on the ill-fated STS-107, flew the MATV F-16 during flight testing at Edwards AFB.) Meanwhile, General Dynamics had received a contract in 1988 to develop the Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA). The F-16 VISTA effort was funded by the USAF, the U.S. Navy, and NASA. Calspan, a subcontractor to GD, fitted a Block 30 F-16D belonging to Wright Labs with a center stick (in addition to the sidestick controller), a new computer, and a digital flight control system that allowed it to imitate, to a degree, the performance of other aircraft. Redesignated NF-16D, its first flight in the VISTA configuration occurred on 9 April 1992.[97][130] In 1993, the variable-stability computers and center stick were temporarily removed from the VISTA for flight tests for the MATV program, under which the first use of thrust-vectoring in flight was accomplished on 30 July. Thrust-vectoring was enabled through the use of the Axisymmetric Vectoring Exhaust Nozzle (AVEN). Following the conclusion of MATV testing in March 1994, the VISTA variable-stability computers were reinstalled. In 1996 a program was begun to fit the NF-16D with a multi-directional thrust-vectoring nozzle, but the program was canceled due to lack of funding later that year. Although the F-16 VISTA program was considered successful, thrust vectoring was not taken up for the F-16 by the U.S. Air Force.[130][131] The F-16U was one of several configurations proposed for the United Arab Emirates in the early 1990s. The F-16U was a two-seat aircraft that combined many features of the F-16XL and the delta wing of the F-16X.[132] In March 1980, General Dynamics began converting the sixth FSD F-16A to serve as the technology demonstrator aircraft for the joint Flight Dynamics Laboratory-NASA Advanced Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI) program. The AFTI F-16 built upon GD's experience with its YF-16 CCV program, and the AFTI F-16 even received the twin pivoting vertical ventral fins from the CCV aircraft, which were likewise installed under the air intake. The aircraft was also fitted with a narrow dorsal fairing along its spine to house additional electronics. Technologies introduced and tested on the AFTI F-16 include a full-authority triplex Digital Flight Control System (DFCS), a six-degree-of-freedom Automated Maneuvering Attack System (AMAS), a 256-word-capacity Voice-Controlled Interactive Device (VCID) to control the avionics suite, and a helmet-mounted target designation sight that permitted the forward-looking infrared (FLIR) device and the radar to be automatically \"slaved\" to the pilot's head movement. First flight of the AFTI F-16 occurred on 10 July 1982. The Air Force Association gave its 1987 Theodore von Karman Award for the most outstanding achievement in science and engineering to the AFTI F-16 team.[97][133] The AFTI F-16 participated in numerous research and development programs:[134] Due to the unavailability of the AFTI F-16 following the AGCAS effort, a Block 25 F-16D was modified for continued investigation of ground collision-avoidance system (GCAS) technologies to reduce CFIT incidents; this joint effort by the USAF, Lockheed Martin, NASA and the Swedish Air Force was conducted during 1997–98.[136] It has recently been reported that the US Air Force had decided to upgrade the F-16, F-22 and F-35 (all Lockheed Martin-designed, fly-by-wire fighters) with the AGCAS system.[137] The F-16 Agile Falcon was a variant proposed by General Dynamics in 1984 that featured a 25% larger wing, upgraded engine, and some already planned MSIP IV improvements for the basic F-16. Unsuccessfully offered as a low-cost alternative for the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) competition, some of its capabilities were incorporated into the F-16C/D Block 40, and the Agile Falcon would serve as the basis for developing Japan's F-2 fighter.[138] The F-16 Enhanced Strategic (ES) was an extended-range variant of the F-16C/D fitted with conformal fuel tanks that granted it a 40% greater range over the standard Block 50. The F-16ES also featured an internal FLIR system, which offered the capabilities of the LANTIRN navigation and targeting system without the drag associated with external pods. Unsuccessfully offered to Israel as an alternative to the F-15I Strike Eagle in late 1993, it was one of several configuration options offered to the United Arab Emirates that would ultimately lead to the development of the F-16E/F Block 60 for that nation. An F-16C Block 30 was modified to the ES configuration to test the conformal tanks and simulated FLIR sensor turrets fitted above and below the nose of the aircraft. The F-16ES first flew on 5 November 1994 and flight testing was completed in January 1995.[139][140] The F-16 Low-Observable Axisymmetric Nozzle (LOAN) demonstrator was an F-16C fitted in late 1996 with a prototype nozzle with significantly reduced radar and infrared signatures and lowered maintenance requirements. It was tested in November 1996 to evaluate the technology for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program.[141][142][143] MANAT, the Israeli Air Force's flight test center, is known to operate a specially built Block 40 F-16D delivered in 1987 as a testbed aircraft designated 'CK-1'. It is used by the IAF for testing new flight configurations, weapon systems, and avionics.[138] The DSI concept (Diverterless supersonic inlet) was introduced into the JAST/JSF program as a trade study item in mid-1994. The first Lockheed DSI was flown on 11 December 1996 as part of a Technology Demonstration project. A DSI was installed on an F-16 Block 30 fighter, replacing the aircraft's original intake diverter. The modified F-16 demonstrated a maximum speed of Mach 2.0 (Mach 2.0 is the F-16's clean certified maximum speed) and handling characteristics similar to a normal F-16. Subsonic specific excess power was slightly improved. The trade studies involved additional CFD, testing, and weight and cost analyses. A DSI was later incorporated into the design of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II after proving to be 30% lighter and showing lower production and maintenance costs over traditional inlets while still meeting all performance requirements.[144] In response to President Jimmy Carter's February 1977 directive to curtail arms proliferation by selling only reduced-capability weapons to foreign countries, General Dynamics developed a modified export-oriented version of the F-16A/B designed for use with the outdated General Electric J79 turbojet engine. Northrop competed for this market with its F-20 Tigershark. Accommodating the J79-GE-119 engine required modification of the F-16's inlet, the addition of steel heat shielding, a transfer gearbox (to connect the engine to the existing F-16 gearbox), and an 18-inch (46 cm) stretch of the aft fuselage. First flight occurred on 29 October 1980. The total program cost to develop the F-16/J79 was US$18,000,000 (equivalent to $68,692,246 in 2024), and the unit flyaway cost was projected to be about US$8,000,000 (equivalent to $30,529,887 in 2024). South Korea, Pakistan and other nations were offered these fighters but rejected them, resulting in numerous exceptions being made to sell standard F-16s; with the later relaxation of the policy under President Carter in 1980 and its cancellation under President Ronald Reagan, no examples of either the F-16/79 or the F-20 were ultimately sold.[145] In February 1979, General Electric was awarded a US$79,900,000 (equivalent to $346,160,064 in 2024) contract under the joint USAF/Navy Derivative Fighter Engine (DFE) program to develop a variant of its F101 turbofan engine, originally designed for the B-1A bomber, for use on the F-16 (in lieu of the standard P&W F100) and the F-14A (in place of the P&W TF30). The first Full-Scale Development (FSD) F-16A (serial number 75-0745) was fitted with the F101X DFE engine and made its maiden flight on 19 December 1980. Although the F101 performed better than the F100, it was not adopted for use; however, data from testing the F-16/101 assisted in the development of the F110 turbofan, for which the F101 would serve as the core, and the F110 would become an alternate engine for both the F-16 and F-14.[146][147] The Vought/General Dynamics Model 1600 was a navalized derivative of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon designed for the United States Navy's Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF) program. The Model 1600 lost to the Northrop/McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. For the F-X2 fighter programme for the Brazilian Air Force, Lockheed Martin offered the F-16BR Super Viper. The F-16BR is based on the F-16E/F Block 60 and features conformal fuel tanks; AN/APG-80 AESA radar, GE F110-132A engine with FADEC controls; electronic warfare suite and infra-red searching (IRST); updated glass cockpit; and a helmet-mounted cueing system. F-16BR lost in the competition with JAS-39 Gripen E.[148] Lockheed Martin has proposed an advanced variant, the F-16IN, as its candidate for India's 126-aircraft Indian Air Force Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) competition. According to Chuck Artymovich, the company's business development director for the program, \"The F-16IN is the most advanced F-16 ever.\" Notable F-16IN features include an AN/APG-80 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, advanced electronic warfare suites, and an infrared search and track (IRST) system.[149] In addition, the F-16IN's RCS is reduced from 1.5m2 to 0.1m2, in the same class as the F-18 Super Hornet, Rafale, and Eurofighter Typhoon.[150] If selected as the winner of the competition, Lockheed Martin will supply the first 18 aircraft, and will set up an assembly line in India in collaboration with Indian partners for production of the remainder. The program is reportedly worth up to ₹550 billion (US$14 billion).[151][152] The F-16IN Super Viper was showcased in the Aero India, 2009.[153] India initially sent the RFI for an F-16C/D Block 52+ configuration aircraft for the ongoing Indian MRCA competition to supply the Indian Air Force with 126 Multi-Role Combat Aircraft, to replace the Indian air force's fleet of MiG-21s. On 17 January 2008, Lockheed Martin offered a customized version of the F-16, the F-16IN Super Viper for the Indian MMRCA contract.[154] The F-16IN, which is similar to the F-16 Block 60, will be a 4.5 generation aircraft. Lockheed Martin has described the F-16IN as \"the most advanced and capable F-16 ever.\" Based closely on the F-16E/F Block 60 as supplied to the UAE, the features on the F-16IN include Conformal fuel tanks (CFTs); AN/APG-80 AESA radar,[155] GE F110-132A engine with 32,000 pounds (143 kN) of thrust with FADEC controls; electronic warfare suite and infra-red search and track (IRST); advanced all-color glass cockpit with three large displays; and a helmet-mounted cueing system.[156] Lockheed Martin's vice-president-Business Development (India) Orville Prins has said that \"I can assure you, the Super Viper is much more advanced in all aspects than the [Block 50/52+] F-16s being given to Pakistan\".[157] In September 2009, F-16IN Super Viper completed a part of the field trials. Lockheed Martin officials stated that phase I of field trials was over and the week-long training phase was in preparation for Phase II of field trials, which began 7 September and lasted two weeks. Eventually, the F-16IN Super Viper lost out to the French Dassault Rafale fighter. It was reported 21 September 2012 that the Indian air force would finalize a contract to purchase 126 French Rafale jet fighters that year, in one of 2012's largest armament purchases.[158] The contract for the 126 Rafale twin-engine, canard delta-wing, multirole combat aircraft is worth $20 billion, Indo-Asian News Service reported. In 2015, after the Rafale order was cut back to just 36 aircraft, Lockheed was offering India the exclusive opportunity to produce, operate and export F-16 Block 70 aircraft.[159] In 2017, the F-16IN lost in the competition with JAS-39 Gripen E, when Lockheed retired from production in India and decided to move its production line from Fort Worth, Texas to Greenville, South Carolina.[160] As of 2017, Lockheed Martin has agreed to sign a letter of intent with the Indian defence firm Tata Advanced Systems Limited to manufacture the jets in India if the Indian government accepts their tender for India's request for a purchase of single-engine aircraft to replace its aging MiG-series fighters. The new production line can be utilized to supply jets to India as well as for exporting them overseas.[161][162] On 19 June 2017, during the Paris Air Show, Tata Advanced Systems Limited and Lockheed Martin signed an agreement to produce F-16 Block 70 aircraft in India under the latter's offer to provide the jet to the Indian Air Force under MMRCA.[163] After cancelling the MMRCA tender, the Indian Air Force launched another Request for Information in April 2018 for another tender for around 110 aircraft which was unofficially referred to as MRFA.[164] Meanwhile, Tata Advanced Systems Limited and Lockheed Martin signed another agreement to produce F-16 wings in India on 4 September 2018.[165] As of September 2019, the prototype wing from the Indian facility would be delivered by 2020.[166] The wing prototype made in the Hyderabad facility of Tata-Lockheed Martin Aerostructures Ltd (TLMAL) was delivered and certified in December 2021, paving way for the facility to be the sole provider of F-16 wings to Lockheed Martin. The wings were described as \"a fuel-carrying 9G, 12,000-hour, interchangeable and replaceable fighter wing\".[167][168] It is the same facility which is also the sole provider of empennages of C-130J at a rate of 24 units per year and produced 85 units by April 2018.[169] Lockheed Martin unveiled the F-21 concept at the Aero India air show on 20 February 2019. The F-21 would include 114 \"Indian Specific Enhancements\". Lockheed Martin had offered the F-16IN variant earlier in the MMRCA tender and has replaced the offer with the current F-21 which is to be built in collaboration with Tata Advanced Systems in the available Hyderabad facility.[170][171][172] Specific enhancements and changes of the F-21 aircraft includes:[173][174][175] Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) produced 140 KF-16C/D Block 52 fighters under license from Lockheed Martin in the 1990s. The F/A-18 Hornet had originally won the Korea Fighter Program (KFP) competition, but disputes over costs and accusations of bribery led the Korean government to withdraw the award and select the F-16 instead. Designated the KF-16 the first 12 aircraft were delivered to Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) in December 1994.[176] Almost 2,500 parts are changed from the original F-16C/D.[176] Originally, the KF-16 was equipped with the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-229 Improved Performance Engine, ASPJ internal ECM, AN/APG-68(V)7 radar, LANTIRN targeting and navigation pod, AMRAAM, HARM, and SLAM anti-ship missile capabilities, and advanced IFF.[177] JDAMs capability was added by ROKAF later on; ROKAF developed the software, successfully carried out 3 tests, and finished pilot training at the end of January 2011. The South Korean JDAMs are equipped with wing kits, which are absent from normal JDAMs, but not from the 2,000-pound JDAM Extended Range kit, which is being developed by Boeing and South Korea.[178] The South Korean F-16s can also employ LIG Nex1's ALQ-200K radar jammer and other locally developed tactical ELINT and EO/IR targeting pods.[179][180] In late 2011, Korea kicked off the contest for KF-16's mid-life upgrade, which will incorporate, among others, a new AESA radar.[181] The radar candidates are Northrop Grumman's Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) and Raytheon's RANGR, which won the contract.[182] The variant to which the planes will be improved is reported to be Lockheed Martin's newly developed F-16V. The KF-16 will also be integrated with stealth cruise missiles.[183] The proposed budget for the avionics upgrades and weapons integration of 135 KF-16 planes is $1 billion.[184] ROKAF had requested a separate upgrade of its 35 F-16 Block 32 in 2009, which would allow the upgraded planes to employ JDAM, AMRAAM, improved data modem, secure voice capabilities, test and support equipment, and other related training and logistics support. The estimated cost of the upgrade was $250 million.[185] BAE won the contract for $1.1 billion.[186] Small numbers of each type of F-16A/B/C are used for non-flying ground instruction of maintenance personnel. The USAF plans to convert Block 15 F-16As, and Block 25/30 F-16Cs into full-scale target drones under the QF-16 Air Superiority Target (AST) program.[187] These AST drones are used in Weapon System Evaluation Programs (WSEP) for assessing upgrades or replacements for air-to-air missiles (AAM), and they are also useful for giving pilots the experience of a live AAM shot and kill prior to entering combat. QF-16s replaced the QF-4 drones, the last of which flew in 2016.[188] The Air Force's Air Armament Center hosted its first \"Industry Day\" for interested vendors at Eglin AFB, Florida on 16–19 July 2007.[189] The DoD awarded the nearly $70 million QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) contract to Boeing on 8 March 2010,[190] with the first delivery scheduled for 2014.[191] On 22 April 2010, the first F-16 to be converted to an aerial target arrived at Boeing's facility at Cecil Field, Jacksonville, Florida.[192] Six F-16s will be modified during the development phase, as prototypes for engineering tests and evaluation. From 2014, up to 126 QF-16 drones will be created. The prototype QF-16 undertook its maiden flight in May 2012. In January 2013, the 576th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Squadron refit team was due to begin modification work on the QF-16 program. Davis-Monthan has 210 F-16s stocked for conversion. From that pool, the Air Force will draw airframes for its 126 planned QF-16 drones.[193] F-16C Block 30B s/n 85-1569 was the first aircraft delivered in November 2012. On 19 September 2013, an empty F-16 jet tested by Boeing and US Air Force, two US Air Force pilots controlled the plane from the ground as it flew from Tyndall Air Force Base, Panama City, Florida.[194] Boeing suggested that the innovation could ultimately be used to help train pilots, providing an adversary they could practice firing on. The jet – which had previously sat mothballed at an Arizona site for 15 years – flew at an altitude of 40,000 ft (12.2 km) and a speed of Mach 1.47 (1,119 mph/1,800 km/h). It carried out a series of maneuvers including a barrel roll and a \"split S\" – a move in which the aircraft turns upside down before making a half loop so that it flies the right-way-up in the opposite direction. This can be used in combat to evade missile lock-ons. The firm added that the flight attained 7 g of acceleration but was capable of carrying out maneuvers at 9 g – something that might cause physical problems for a pilot.[195] Boeing was awarded the contract on 10 October 2013 for low-rate initial production (LRIP) Lot 1 of 13 QF-16s. A second award on 20 May 2014 covered production Lot 2, comprising a further 23 QF-16s. On 27 March 2015, Boeing received a US$24.46 million (~$31.5 million in 2024) contract for 25 Lot 3 QF-16s and 25 four-year warranties of the QF-16 drone-peculiar equipment. The first production Lot 1 FSAT, QF-16C, 86-0233, 'QF-007', was delivered on 11 March 2015 to Tyndall Air Force Base. It was previously operated by the Michigan Air National Guard's 107th Fighter Squadron, 127th Wing and then stored at the 309th AMARG before being moved to Cecil Field in April 2013 for QF-16 configuring.[196] On 19 July 2017, the first QF-16 was shot down during a Combat Archer Weapons System Evaluation Program (WSEP) exercise.[197] The performance and flexibility of the F-16 has been an important and visible influence on aircraft development programs of three nations seeking to advance the design and manufacturing skills of their indigenous aerospace industries. These programs have partnered with Lockheed Martin to develop airframes, that while not officially designated F-16s, share design elements and a development path with the F-16. Due to an American refusal to supply Taiwan with either the F-16/79 or F-20, the Republic of China government tasked its Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) with developing an indigenous fighter. Preliminary design studies began in 1980, and the Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) program was launched two years later. Since Taiwanese industry had not developed a sophisticated fighter before, AIDC sought design and development assistance from General Dynamics and other major American aerospace companies.[198] With such assistance, a design was finalized in 1985. The IDF design is by no means a copy of the F-16, but it was clearly influenced by the F-16, such as the layout of control surfaces, yet it also features design elements from the F-5, like its twin-engine configuration. Several components were supplied by Western companies.[199] In December 1988 the IDF aircraft was designated F-CK-1 and named after the late President Chiang Ching-Kuo. The first of four prototypes (three single-seat and one twin-seat) flew on 28 May 1989. A total of 130 Ching Kuo fighters (102 F-CK-1A single-seaters and 28 F-CK-1B two-seaters) were delivered from 1994 to 2000.[200][201][202][unreliable source?] In 1982, Japan's Technical Research and Development Institute (TRDI) initiated studies of options for an indigenous fighter design to replace the Mitsubishi F-1 strike fighter. This initiative would later be designated FS-X (Fighter Support Experimental; the two-seat trainer version was originally designated 'TFS-X'.) Determining that an entirely indigenous development effort would be cost-prohibitive, the Defense Agency (JDA) sought an off-the-shelf fighter for its FS-X requirement, but none proved entirely acceptable. As a result, the JDA sought a co-development program based on a variant of an existing fighter type, and on 21 October 1987 announced its selection of a modified version of the F-16C/D based on General Dynamics' \"Agile Falcon\" concept. The FS-X is larger and heavier than the F-16, has a greater wing area, and is mainly fitted with Japanese-developed avionics and equipment. The program was launched a year later and the first of four XF-2A/B prototypes flew on 7 October 1995. The Japanese Cabinet authorized production on 15 December 1995, with the designation F-2A/B being allocated to the single- and two-seat models, respectively. First flight of an F-2A occurred on 12 October 1999, and production aircraft deliveries began on 25 September 2000. Originally, 141 F-2A/B (83 F-2A and 58 F-2B) were planned, but only 130 (83/47 F-2A/B) were approved in 1995; due to high costs, in December 2004, the total was capped at 98 aircraft, and in early 2007 this was reduced to 94.[203][204][205][206][unreliable source?] Building on its licensed manufacture of KF-16s, in 1992 Samsung Aerospace began work on designing a tandem-seat, supersonic, combat-capable jet trainer to replace the BAE Hawk 67, Northrop T-38 Talon, A-37 Dragonfly, and eventually F-4 Phantom II and F-5E/F Tiger II operated by the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF). Samsung worked closely with Lockheed and the basic KTX-2 design had been laid out by 1995. At this point the aerospace units of Samsung, Daewoo and Hyundai were combined to form Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to ensure sufficient industrial \"critical mass\" existed to successfully develop the KTX-2. The T-50 resembles an 80%-scale F-16, but has a number of differences, not least being the fact that it has an engine air intake under each wing root, instead of a single under-belly intake, as well as a leading-edge extension more similar to that on the F/A-18 Hornet. The South Korean government gave its approval on 3 July 1997, and full-scale development work got underway in October. In February 2000, the KTX-2 was designated the T-50 Golden Eagle, and the first of two T-50 flight-test prototypes flew on 20 August 2002; the maiden flight of the first of two T-50 Lead-In Fighter Trainer (LIFT) prototypes – designated 'A-50' by the ROKAF and capable of combat – followed on 29 August 2003. Lockheed Martin and KAI co-marketed the T-50 internationally.[207] The RoKAF plans to acquire T-50 advanced trainers, T-50B aerobatic demonstrators, TA-50 LIFT/light attack aircraft, and FA-50 multirole fighters. Its first production contract, for 25 T-50s, was placed in December 2003 and the first pair of T-50 aircraft was delivered 29 December 2005, with the type entering operational service in April 2007. In December 2006, the ROKAF placed a second production contract for T-50, T-50B, and TA-50 variants. The development of the FA-50 to replace the remaining old fighters is ongoing as of 2010[update].[208][209][210][unreliable source?] Sources: USAF sheet,[211] International Directory of Military Aircraft,[212] Great Book,[213] F-16 versions on F-16.net,[214] Lockheed Martin[215]"}

It is named after a species of diving bird in reference to its intended role as a submarine-launched UAV. It was hoped that it could provide all- weather ISR&T, bomb/battle damage assessment, armed reconnaissance, and special operation forces mission support.[1] The U.S. Navy's Ohio-class submarines, feature large, 44-foot-long (13 m), 7-foot-diameter (2.1 m), tubes to launch Trident missiles. Researchers at Skunk Works had the idea of creating a drone aircraft that can be stored in those missile tubes. DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) provided funding for tests of models and some of the systems on board the Cormorant. The tests were completed by September 2006. After the tests were complete, DARPA was to determine whether it will fund a flying prototype. While achieving goals and capabilities during tests, DARPA cancelled the contract due to budget cuts in FY08. While in the tube, the aircraft's wings are folded around itself. The Cormorant, while floating to the surface, unfolds its wings and prepares itself for launch. Rockets then assist the aircraft with lifting off from the water's surface. A normal aircraft would never survive the pressures that are encountered at a launch depth of 150 ft (46 m). To prevent corrosion, the Cormorant was made from titanium, and to resist crushing, empty spaces were taken up with plastic foam. The interior of the craft was filled with a pressurized inert gas. To keep the Cormorant watertight, the doors, inlets, and any covers required inflatable seals. One principal means of defense for a submarine is the ability to remain hidden underwater. Thus having an aircraft lift off near the submarine or come directly back to the submarine after its objective is complete would give away the submarine's position. To combat this, the submarine was to slip away while the Cormorant is floating to the surface. After its objective has been completed, the submarine was to transmit rendezvous coordinates to the Cormorant. A robotic retrieval vehicle was then to fetch the drone after it has landed on the surface of the water.

Its first flight was on March 29, 1996. The Department of Defense terminated DarkStar in January 1999, after determining the UAV was not aerodynamically stable and was not meeting cost and performance objectives.[1] The RQ-3 DarkStar was designed as a \"high-altitude endurance UAV\", and incorporated stealth aircraft technology[2][3] to make it difficult to detect, which allowed it to operate within heavily defended airspace, unlike the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk, which is unable to operate except under conditions of air supremacy. The DarkStar was fully autonomous: it could take off, fly to its target, operate its sensors, transmit information, return and land without human intervention. Human operators, however, could change the DarkStar's flight plan and sensor orientation through radio or satellite relay. The RQ-3 carried either an optical sensor or radar, and could send digital information to a satellite while still in flight. It used a single airbreathing jet engine of unknown type for propulsion. One source claims it used a Williams-Rolls-Royce FJ44-1A turbofan engine.[4] The first prototype made its first flight on March 29, 1996, but its second flight, on April 22, 1996, ended in a crash shortly after takeoff. A modified, more stable design (the RQ-3A) first flew on June 29, 1998, and made a total of five flights before the program was canceled just prior to the sixth and final flight planned for the airworthiness test phase. Two additional RQ-3As were built, but never made any flights before program cancellation.[5] The \"R\" is the Department of Defense designation for reconnaissance; \"Q\" means unmanned aircraft system. The \"3\" refers to it being the third of a series of purpose-built unmanned reconnaissance aircraft systems.

While the USAF has released few details on the UAV's design or capabilities, defense analysts believe that it is a stealth aircraft fitted with aerial reconnaissance equipment. Introduced in 2007, it was deployed to Afghanistan in late 2007, South Korea two years later in September 2009, and was likely used during the 2026 United States strikes in Venezuela. Some images and details of the aircraft were released after Iran captured an RQ-170 in 2011. It has a flying wing design, and uses a single engine, speculated to be either a General Electric TF34 turbofan or a Garrett TFE731. The RQ-170 Sentinel was developed by Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works as a stealth unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Journalists have noted design similarities between the RQ-170 and previous stealth and UAV programs such as the Lockheed Martin RQ-3 DarkStar and Polecat.[3][4] An Air Force official said, \"It's the same concept as [the RQ-3] DarkStar, it's stealthy, and it uses the same apertures and data links, only it's bigger.\"[3] It is a tailless flying wing aircraft with pods built into the upper surface of each wing.[5][6] According to the United States Army Training Circular 3-01.80, the Sentinel has a wingspan of 65 feet 7 inches (20 m), and is 14 feet 9 inches (4.50 m) long.[7][8] In a December 2012 report, journalist David Axe stated that \"20 or so\" RQ-170s had been built.[9] The \"RQ\" designation (R for reconnaissance, Q for unmanned) indicates that the RQ-170 Sentinel does not carry weapons.[10] Aviation Week & Space Technology's David A. Fulghum believes that the UAV is probably a \"tactical, operations-oriented platform and not a strategic intelligence-gathering design\".[5] The USAF confirmed the \"grainy photos of a gray, flying-wing-typed unmanned airplane near Kandahar Airfield.\"[11] Since then, this aircraft has been known as \"The Beast of Kandahar\" in relation to the sighting of the RQ-170 Sentinel on 4 December 2009.[5][12] A USAF colonel subsequently commented that RQ-170 is separate from the MQ-X program, which has yet to determine stealth or powerplant requirements, and thus the Sentinel will not replace the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator and General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper drones.[13] In 2021, the 432nd Air Expeditionary Wing made a statement in which they said that \"the 432nd AEW has ... successfully deployed and redeployed RQ-170 Sentinel forces.\"[1] The RQ-170 is a flying wing design containing a single (as yet classified) engine, and was estimated in 2009 by Aviation Week as having a wingspan of approximately 66 feet (20 m).[14] Its takeoff weight is estimated as being greater than the RQ-3 DarkStar's, which was 8,500 pounds (3,900 kg). The design lacks several elements common to stealth engineering, such as zigzag edged landing gear doors and sharp leading edges, and the exhaust is not shielded by the wing.[14] Aviation Week postulates that these elements suggest the designers have avoided \"highly sensitive technologies\" due to the near certainty of eventual operational loss inherent with a single engine design and a desire to avoid the risk of compromising leading edge technology.[14] The publication also suggests that the medium-grey color implies a mid-altitude ceiling, unlikely to exceed 50,000 feet (15,000 m), since a higher ceiling would normally be painted darker for concealment.[14] The postulated weight and ceiling parameters suggests the possible use of a General Electric TF34 engine, or a variant in the airframe.[14] On the basis of the few publicly available photographs of the RQ-170, aviation expert Bill Sweetman has assessed that the UAV is equipped with an electro-optical/infrared sensor and possibly an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar mounted in its belly fairing. He has also speculated that the two undercarriage fairings over the UAV's wings may house datalinks and that the belly fairing could be designed for modular payloads, allowing the UAV to be used for strike missions and/or electronic warfare.[15] The New York Times has reported that the RQ-170 is \"almost certainly\" equipped with communications intercept equipment, as well as highly sensitive hyperspectral sensors capable of detecting very small amounts of radioactive isotopes and chemicals that may indicate the existence of nuclear weapons facilities.[16][17] Following Iranian claims of downing an RQ-170 near the Afghan border in December 2011, Iranian TV showed video footage of what appears to be an advanced unmanned U.S. aircraft that most closely resembles the RQ-170 UAV. In the footage, a member of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard released dimensions of the aircraft, including a wingspan of about 26 metres (85 ft), a height of 1.84 metres (6.0 ft), and a length of 4.5 metres (15 ft).[18] The 30th Reconnaissance Squadron was the first unit to operate RQ-170 Sentinels. Based at Tonopah Test Range Airport in Nevada, this squadron was activated on 1 September 2005. RQ-170 Sentinels have been deployed to Afghanistan, where one was sighted at Kandahar Airfield in late 2007.[5][19] This sighting, and the Sentinel's secret status at the time, led Sweetman to dub it the \"Beast of Kandahar\".[20] The UAV being deployed to Afghanistan, despite the Taliban having no radar, led to speculation that the aircraft was used to spy on Pakistan or Iran. Phil Finnegan, a UAV analyst at an aerospace consulting firm, suggests the stealth capabilities of the Sentinel are being used to fly in nearby countries. Iran has an air defense system that would require stealth technology to penetrate.[21][22] In December 2009, South Korea's JoongAng Daily newspaper reported that the RQ-170 Sentinel had been test-flown in South Korea for the past few months and that it was expected to be permanently deployed in 2010 to replace Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft operating from Osan Air Base.[23] In response to this report, Sweetman argued that the Sentinel's deployments to Afghanistan and South Korea were probably undertaken to monitor Pakistan and North Korea's ballistic missile programs.[24] In 2020, through an FOIA request, it was revealed that the USAF ordered the deployment of the drone to Kunsan Air Base on 4 September 2009. It is unknown exactly how many RQ-170s were deployed.[25] On 2 May 2011, at least one RQ-170 monitored the area while elements of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group launched an assault on the compound which resulted in bin Laden's death. The aircraft provided footage of the attack which was watched live by President Barack Obama and his senior national security advisors. The RQ-170 also monitored Pakistani military radio transmissions in the area to provide warning of the response to the attack.[26] On 27 May the Los Angeles Times reported that Pakistani officials were \"alarmed\" by the use of the RQ-170 over their country as the drones are \"designed to evade radar and other surveillance systems, and can be used as a spy plane\".[27] In October 2012 a RQ-170 was used to conduct bomb damage assessment for a test drop of a Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb from a Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber.[28] The 44th Reconnaissance Squadron was established on 1 April 2015. While the USAF did not disclose what aircraft the unit was equipped with, it has been reported that it was established to operate RQ-170s.[29][30] From 4 August 2020 to 6 August 2020, at least one RQ-170 participated in a $1.4 million Large Force Test Event at Nellis Air Force Base, in Nevada.[31] It is believed that between 20 and 30 RQ-170s were in service with the USAF as of 2021. At this time, the type continued to be operated by the 30th and 44th Reconnaissance Squadrons. The USAF disclosed a deployment of RQ-170s in March 2021, but did not identify where they had operated.[1] In January 2026, at least 1 RQ-170 were used during the United States strikes in Venezuela.[32] On 4 December 2011, media reports stated that the Iranian Army's electronic warfare unit had downed an RQ-170 that violated Iranian airspace along its eastern border through overriding its controls, and had captured the lightly damaged UAV.[18] On 6 December, U.S. officials acknowledged that a drone crashed in or near Iranian airspace and that it belonged to the CIA, and not to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) as was earlier stated by the US government.[33] The Iranian government released footage of a captured RQ-170 on 8 December.[34] After examining the video that same day, U.S. officials confirmed that the drone was genuine.[35][36] In April 2012, General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps aerospace division, claimed that Iran had reverse-engineered the RQ-170, and was building a copy of the UAV. He also stated that data was being recovered from the captured RQ-170.[37][38][39] The semi-official Tasnim news agency of Iran reported in September 2016 that a UAV named Saegheh-2, similar in appearance to the RQ-170 Sentinel, had been built. It was said to be able to carry four precision-guided bombs; the range was not stated. The Shahed 171 Simorgh is also based on the downed Sentinel.[40] The Israeli military shot down a Saegheh drone during the February 2018 Israel–Syria incident. Israeli media reported that the UAV's design was indeed largely based on the RQ-170, while IAF Brigadier General Tomer Bar said that the drone was quite advanced and emulated western technology.[41] Data from The Drive, Army Training Circular 3-01.80[7][42] General characteristics Performance"}

It was proposed privately in 2013 by Lockheed Martin as a successor to the retired Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. As of 2025, no confirmed flight tests have occurred and the SR‑72 remains a design concept with speculation persisting about potential service entry in the 2030s.[2] The SR-71 Blackbird, which flew Mach 3 at 80,000 feet, was retired by the United States Air Force in 1998,[3] eliminating a unique and valuable intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability.[citation needed] Although most fifth-generation jet fighters and planned drones intended for enemy airspace rely on anti-radar stealth technologies, Professor Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow in airpower and technology at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), argues that the rise of anti-access/area denial tactics and counter-stealth technologies renders speed more promising than stealth for penetrating protected airspace.[4][5] The first unconfirmed reports about the SR-72 emerged in 2007, when various sources reported that Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs (ADP) division, Skunk Works, was developing an aircraft capable of flying at six times the speed of sound, or Mach 6 (4,000 mph; 6,400 km/h; 3,500 kn), for the United States Air Force—about twice as fast as the SR-71.[6][7] Since 2006, Lockheed Martin had been working to develop a suitable engine with Aerojet Rocketdyne. After the HTV-3X (DARPA FALCON Project) was cancelled in 2008, Aerojet Rocketdyne applied its scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) technology to the SR-72's engine design. The SR-72 was envisioned to have an air-breathing propulsion system that could operate at subsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic speeds.[8] Turbojet engines can function from zero speed and typically perform best up to Mach 2.2.[9] Ramjets, which rely on aerodynamic compression with subsonic combustion, perform poorly below Mach 0.5, are most efficient around Mach 3, and can operate up to about Mach 6. (The SR-71's engines shifted to low-speed ramjets by redirecting airflow around the core and into the afterburner at speeds exceeding Mach 2.5.) Scramjets can cover the high-supersonic-to-hypersonic range. The SR-72 was to employ a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) system, with a turbine engine for low speeds and a scramjet for high speeds.[3] The engines would share an inlet and nozzle but have separate airflow paths.[10][11] At speeds of Mach 5 and above, aerodynamic heating generates temperatures sufficient to melt conventional metallic airframes, prompting engineers to consider making critical components from composites such as the high-performance carbon, ceramic, and metal mixes used in intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and the retired Space Shuttle. On November 1, 2013, Aviation Week & Space Technology published an article on the SR-72's development.[8][3] Public interest in the news was so intense that it overwhelmed the magazine's servers.[12] Lockheed Martin officials announced plans to build an optionally piloted scaled demonstrator, about 60 feet (~18 meters) long—comparable in size to a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor—powered by a single full-scale engine to achieve Mach 6 for several minutes. They projected it would be ready by 2018 for flight testing aligned with the High Speed Strike Weapon timeline.[8][3] The production version of the SR-72, company officials said, would resemble the SR-71 in size at over 100 ft (30 m) long, share its range, and enter service by 2030. It was intended to follow the U.S. Air Force's hypersonic roadmap, targeting a hypersonic strike weapon by 2020 and a penetrating ISR aircraft by 2030. Lockheed officials noted they had discussed the project with government officials but had not secured funding for the prototype or engine.[8][3] On November 13, 2013, Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh expressed the Air Force's interest in hypersonic flight, noting it would shorten an adversary's reaction time to operations. He highlighted it as one of several capabilities that could counter advanced air defenses. Welsh acknowledged the service was pursuing hypersonic technology but lacked the materials to build a full-sized aircraft like the uncrewed SR-72. He also clarified that the Air Force had not engaged with Lockheed Martin regarding the SR-72.[13] By December 2013, the Air Force declined to fund the SR-72 program. Facing budget constraints, the service chose instead to develop the Northrop Grumman RQ-180 stealth UAV—anticipated to be less costly and complex to design and produce—for ISR missions in contested airspace.[14] In December 2014, NASA awarded Lockheed Martin a contract to study the feasibility of developing the SR-72's propulsion system using existing turbine-engine technologies. The $892,292 (~$1.19 million in 2025) contract funded a design study to evaluate the viability of a TBCC propulsion system, integrating one of several current turbine engines with a very-low-Mach-ignition Dual Mode Ramjet (DMRJ). NASA had previously funded a Lockheed Martin study that determined speeds up to Mach 7 were achievable with a dual-mode engine combining turbine and ramjet technologies. The primary challenge in hypersonic propulsion has been bridging the gap between the top speed of a turbojet (around Mach 2.2) and the minimum operational speed of a scramjet (Mach 4), as typical turbine engines cannot accelerate sufficiently for a scramjet to take over. The NASA-Lockheed Martin study explored options such as a higher-speed turbine engine or a scramjet operable within a turbine's slower flight envelope; the DARPA HTV-3X had demonstrated a low-speed ramjet (DMRJ) functional below Mach 3. Existing turbofan engines from jet fighters and experimental designs were considered for modification. If successful, NASA planned to fund a demonstrator to test the DMRJ in a flight research vehicle.[15] On December 15, 2014, NASA's Glenn Research Center awarded Aerojet Rocketdyne a $1,099,916 (~$1.47 million in 2025) contract to support mode-transition research.[11] The two companies were reportedly collaborating on the TBCC propulsion system, aiming to begin development of the SR-72 hypersonic demonstrator in 2018, with an initial flight targeted for 2023.[16] In May 2015, the SR-72 was reported to be envisioned as an ISR and strike platform, though no specific payloads were identified—likely because existing payloads would be inadequate for an aircraft traveling at Mach 6 and up to 80,000 feet (24,400 m) altitude, requiring \"hundreds of miles\" to turn. New sensors and weapons would likely need to be developed specifically for such speeds.[17] In March 2016, Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson announced that the company was on the verge of a technological breakthrough, enabling the SR-72 to reach Mach 6 and permitting a hypersonic demonstrator—roughly the size of an F-22 stealth fighter—to be constructed for under $1 billion.[18][19][20][21] In June 2017, Lockheed Martin announced that the SR-72 would enter development by the early 2020s, with a top speed exceeding Mach 6. Executive Vice President Rob Weiss remarked: \"We've been saying hypersonics [are] two years away for the last 20 years, but all I can say is the technology is mature, and we, along with DARPA and the services, are working hard to get that capability into the hands of our warfighters as soon as possible.\"[22] In January 2018, Lockheed Martin Vice President Jack O'Banion delivered a presentation attributing advancements in additive manufacturing and computer modeling to the SR-72's feasibility, noting that building the aircraft five years earlier would have been impossible and that 3D printing enabled embedding a cooling system in the engine.[23][24] In February 2018, Orlando Carvalho, executive vice president of aeronautics at Lockheed Martin, refuted reports of the SR-72's development, stating that no such aircraft had been produced. He added that hypersonic research was driving weapons development: \"Eventually as that technology is matured, it could ultimately enable the development of a reusable vehicle. Prior to this we may have referred to it as a 'like an SR-72', but now the terminology of choice is 'reusable vehicle'.\"[24] In November 2018, Lockheed Martin reported that a prototype of the SR-72 was scheduled to fly by 2025 and would be equipped to launch hypersonic missiles.[25] The SR-72 could enter service in the 2030s.[26]"}

The resulting X-44A (although apparently unrelated to the previously developed X-44 MANTA) was built in 1999 and first flew in 2001,[1] representing an interim design between the Darkstar and P-175 Polecat. However, Lockheed Martin kept the X-44A under wraps until February 2018.[1][2][3] The X-44A successfully tested multiple technologies. Its design refined tailless aircraft aerodynamics and flight controls. The test program also improved Lockheed Martin’s unmanned command and control system. It also supported other test programs, including a deck-handling demonstration for U.S. Navy carriers.[1] The X-44A is reportedly made from nano-carbon fiber and is powered by a Williams F112 turbofan engine. The wingspan of the X-44A is 30 feet (9.1 m), half of that of the RQ-170 Sentinel.[1][2] The X-44A is currently on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, near Dayton, Ohio, in the Research and Development gallery housed in Building 4, and was put on display in October of 2020.[1] Data from National Museum of the United States Air Force[1] General characteristics Performance  Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists This article on an unmanned aerial vehicle is a stub.

Originally marketed for various competitions as the US101, it was developed and manufactured in the US by a consortium headed by Lockheed Martin, consisting of Lockheed Martin Systems Integration – Owego (LMSI), AgustaWestland and Bell Helicopter. In January 2005, the US101 was selected for the VXX Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program, and was promptly re-designated as the VH-71. However, development was subject to delays, cost overruns, and engineering issues; Lockheed attributed much of these issues to unanticipated and extensive modifications being demanded by the government that had been absent from the request for proposal (RFP) issued. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report in 2011 also recognised that a lack of flexibility and compromise on the part of the government had negatively impacted the program. By late 2008, the cancellation of the VH-71 was looking increasingly likely. In February 2009, President Barack Obama asked Secretary of Defense Robert Gates about placing the project on hold or canceling it because of its high cost: over $13 billion for the planned 28 helicopters. In June 2009, the U.S. Navy terminated the contract after spending about $4.4 billion and taking delivery of nine VH-71s. After the cancellation, the delivered helicopters were sold to Canada for $164 million, where they were used as source of spare parts for its fleet of AgustaWestland CH-149 Cormorant search-and-rescue helicopters. The AgustaWestland AW101, initially designated as EH101, was originally developed and produced by EH Industries, which was a joint venture between the British Westland Helicopters and Italian Agusta companies; Westland merged with Agusta to form AgustaWestland in 2001.[1] AgustaWestland held considerable interest in the export prospects of the AW101, including the prospects for an extensive overseas manufacturing consortium. On 23 July 2002, Lockheed Martin and AgustaWestland announced that they had signed a 10-year agreement to jointly market, manufacture and support a medium-lift helicopter, an AW101 derivative, in the United States. At that time, the team declared that the derivative, which was designated as the US101, would be \"65% American\". The companies envisaged the aircraft being adopted in three major roles; U.S. Air Force combat search and rescue, U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue, and U.S. Marine Corps executive transport.[2][3] In early 2002, the Lockheed-AgustaWestland partnership sought out other firms to participate in the proposed local manufacturing effort for the US101; in particular, the team pursued Bell Helicopters, which was at that time part of another EH101 consortium, offering the type in Canada.[4] That same year, Rolls-Royce Holdings, who manufactured the EH101's RTM322, also sought out an American partner to locally produce the engine; Rolls-Royce also envisioned integrating US-specific technology into the engine and its potential use in powering the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter.[5][6] By August 2002, there were reports in the media, of various US aircraft manufacturers, including Bell, Boeing and Kaman Aerospace, that were holding discussions with the consortium and may potentially be selected as a subcontractor to perform the domestic assembly of the US101.[7][8][9] Boeing showed persistent interest in joining the US101 consortium, as well as in alternate arrangements to produce the NHIndustries NH90 helicopter.[10][11] On 15 May 2003, AgustaWestland signed an agreement with Bell Helicopter to undertake final assembly of the US101 in the U.S.[12][13] Under the pact, AgustaWestland would produce the main rotor blades and main fuselage sections at its headquarters in Yeovil, UK. The company would also manufacture other components, including the gearbox, at its facility in Cascina Costa, Italy; this represents a work share of 36 per cent. The remaining 64 per cent work share was split between Lockheed Martin (31 per cent) and Bell Helicopter (27 per cent) and other firms (6 per cent).[14][15] In February 2002, the US Marine Corps commenced a study to identify potential replacement rotorcraft for the aging Sikorsky VH-3D presidential transport helicopters.[16] On 18 December 2003, the United States Department of Defense issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the supply of 23 helicopters to be used as a replacement for the 11 VH-3Ds and 8 VH-60Ns of the Marine Corps' HMX-1 squadron, which performs the role of Presidential helicopter transportation; this requirement was given the designation of VXX, or the Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program.[17][18] Two companies, AgustaWestland and Sikorsky Aircraft responded to the VXX RFP; additionally, that had been interest in a potential Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey-based bid, however the rotorcraft was deemed to be non-transportable by military airlift and thus unsuitable to qualify.[19][20] Sikorsky had proposed the VH-92, a variant of the H-92 Superhawk, in partnership with FlightSafety International, L-3 Communications, Northrop Grumman, Rockwell Collins, Vought Aircraft Industries, and GE-Aviation.[21][22] During the bidding process, Sikorsky attacked the US101 for its foreign origins; in December 2004, Sikorsky VXX programme manager Nick Lappos derided the bid as: \"\"What is a socialist country and a socialist company going to teach us about competition?\".[23] The selection was originally to occur in April 2004, however programme officials decided to postpone their decision for a further eight months to conduct more analysis on the bids.[24] On 28 January 2005, the Department of Defense announced that it had selected the US101 as the winner.[25][26] It has been speculated that the US101's three engines had been a decisive factor over the rivaling twin-engined VH-92.[27] John Young, the USN's assistant secretary for acquisition technology and logistics, stated of the selection: \"The Lockheed team probably started with a helicopter that needed less. They more closely met the requirements we had laid out, and that allowed them to table less work that had to be completed to get to the finish line and deliver a product\".[28] The US101 team was awarded a US$1.7 billion contract for the System Development and Demonstration phase.[19][29] In July 2005, the US101 received the military designation VH-71 Kestrel.[30] Delays and engineering issues plagued the VH-71's development.[31] By 2007, the estimated cost of developing and modifying the aircraft had risen by 40% to $2.4 billion and had passed the $4.2 billion expected for the production of the fleet.[32] In March 2008, the program cost had risen and was projected to cost a total $11.2 billion,[33] or about $400 million per helicopter.[34] During dialogue over the CSAR-X (in which the EH101 was LMSI's offering), the Air Force Source Selection Authority (SSA) stated the program's performance had been \"unsatisfactory\". In March 2007, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, upholding Sikorsky and Lockheed's protests against Boeing's HH-47, mentioned \"LMSI had received a little confidence rating for past performance due to unsatisfactory performance under its current contract for the VH-71 Presidential helicopter, which was evaluated as the most highly relevant to this procurement.\" The SSA stated that LMSI had \"show[n] that it could not reliably meet important schedule requirements and had difficulty in systems engineering flow-downs to their subcontractors.\"[35] Lockheed responded that government insistence on extensive modifications, unanticipated in the RFP, as the source of cost overruns.[32] A GAO report in 2011 concluded that the VH-71's development was not allowed flexibility or trade-offs considered by the customer.[36] In December 2007, DoD officials met with the White House Military Office to discuss the program's future; the Pentagon had apparently wanted to terminate the VH-71 due to setbacks, budget issues, and design problems. The White House overruled a decision to cancel; the program was effectively placed on hold while options were considered.[37] In July 2008, the VH-71A (also called Increment 1) was to reach operating capability in 2010. The second phase of the development, VH-71B (Increment 2) was expected to start entering service in 2017.[38] In October 2008, while commenting on defense programs likely to be cut following the change in government, John Young, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, stated that the VH-71 \"is very high on that list\".[39] The rising cost of VH-71 program contrasted poorly with President Barack Obama's stance on curbing government spending; during a White House gathering in February 2009 President Obama commented that the procurement process had \"gone amok and we are going to have to fix it.\" He additionally stated that \"The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me.\"[40][41] In March 2009 the projected total cost for the planned 28 VH-71s was over $13 billion.[42] On 6 April 2009 the proposed Defense budget announced by Defense Secretary Robert Gates had not included funding for the VH-71.[43] On 1 June 2009, the U.S. Navy announced that the contract was officially canceled, and that remaining funds were to be reinvested in upgrades to the existing fleet of VH-3D and VH-60N helicopters.[44] Nine VH-71s had been completed at time of the cancellation.[45] The aircraft's cancellation provoked commentators to speak out about its impact on future acquisition contracts with European businesses. The failure by the U.S. Department of Defense acquisition process as demonstrated by the VH-71 may scare away potential partners.[46] Around March 2009, a coalition of lawmakers encouraged the Administration to continue a variation of the VH-71 program. A letter issued by several members of Congress urged the President to support a VH-71 program.[47] On 22 July 2009, the House Appropriations Committee approved $485 million to make five VH-71As operational.[48] The Congressional Research Service (CRS) estimated that shutting down VH-71 production, upgrading the existing fleet, and later implementing a successor program would cost $14–$21 billion. It was reported not only that a new fleet would not be available until 2024 (at which point the existing helicopters would have remained in service while being over 50 years old), but that terminating the existing program would waste more than $3 billion in sunk VH-71 costs.[49] Following the President's decision to terminate the program a variety of lawmakers, think tanks and media outlets publicly concluded it would be more cost-effective and less time-consuming to continue with a variation of the existing VH-71 program.[50] In 2009, the CRS proposed four options: Option 1 was to continue the VH-71 program with Increment I and II versions; the additional cost was estimated at $10 billion and the entry into service date was 2019. Option 2 was to restructure the program to provide 23 Increment I aircraft; at an additional cost of $6.4 billion and would be operational by 2012. Option 3 was a restructure to provide 19 Increment I aircraft to replace the current fleet; the additional cost for this option was estimated at $5.6 billion and the entry into service by 2012. The last option was to upgrade and extend life of current fleet at a cost of $1.4 billion; however this would not meet the standards required for future presidential helicopters, and would require replacement sooner.[51] In addition to the cost of a new procurement program, industry officials stated that to merely extend the operating life of the current fleet is a risky choice because it is both less secure and costly to maintain.[52] Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, including Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Representative Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD) have been outspoken critics of the Pentagon in the matter—Bartlett recently claiming that \"they had this conversation outside the partnership and we regret that.\"[52] Loren Thompson, an analyst for the Lexington Institute, stated \"I do not believe that the story of VH-71 is over... Secretary Gates has not made a convincing case for terminating the program, and there is no alternative helicopter that can satisfy range and payload requirements while still landing on the White House lawn.\"[53] On 19 December 2009, President Obama signed a joint House and Senate Defense Appropriation Bill for FY 2010, which includes $130 million funding for the Marine One program: $100 million to recoup technologies developed under the VH-71 Kestrel program, and $30 million for the Navy's initial studies on a new VH-XX program.[54] In February 2010, the Navy issued a request for information to the aviation industry.[55] In April 2010, Lockheed Martin announced they would team with Sikorsky in offering the Sikorsky S-92 instead of the VH-71.[56][57] In June 2010, Boeing announced it was considering a U.S.-built licensed version of the AgustaWestland AW101 for the renewed VXX program as well as the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey and Boeing CH-47 Chinook.[58][59] In June 2011, the nine VH-71s were purchased for $164 million by Canada for use as spare parts for its fleet of AgustaWestland CH-149 Cormorant search and rescue helicopter, which is also based upon the AW101.[60] The transferred VH-71s were stripped of sensitive parts, and seven remained in an airworthy condition. In 2013, media reports stated Canada is studying whether up to four of the VH-71s can be certified for operational use; manufacturer AgustaWestland has openly stated their support for the regeneration initiative.[61][62][63] On 8 August 2018, it was reported that Leonardo S.p.A. was converting the seven airworthy helicopters into mission-ready CH-149s.[64] The first test VH-71A, Test Vehicle #2 (TV-2), made its initial flight on 3 July 2007 at AgustaWestland's facility in Yeovil in the UK. Lockheed Martin also used an EH101, designated TV-1, for initial testing in the United States; these tests included landing on the lawn of the White House.[65] The first production VH-71A, Pilot Production #1 (PP-1), made its maiden flight on 22 September 2008 from Yeovil. The US Air Force transported the helicopter in a C-17 Globemaster III to Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, for further testing.[66] The first production VH-71 joined the test program at NAS Patuxent River, beginning ground testing in early December 2008.[67] The US101 also competed for two further USAF contracts, the 141-aircraft Combat Search and Rescue Replacement (CSAR-X) project (originally won by the Boeing HH-47 on 10 November 2006, but now subject to a second procurement competition), and the 70-aircraft Common Vertical Lift Support Program (CVLSP).[68] Specifications with an asterisk (*) next to them are specifically for the VH-71.

The X-33 was a technology demonstrator for the VentureStar orbital spaceplane, which was planned to be a next-generation, commercially operated reusable launch vehicle. The X-33 would flight-test a range of technologies that NASA believed it needed for single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicles (SSTO RLVs), such as metallic thermal protection systems, composite cryogenic fuel tanks for liquid hydrogen, the aerospike engine, autonomous (uncrewed) flight control, rapid flight turn-around times through streamlined operations, and its lifting body aerodynamics.[3] Failures of its 21-meter wingspan and multi-lobed, composite-material fuel tank during pressure testing ultimately led to the withdrawal of federal support for the program in early 2001. Lockheed Martin has conducted unrelated testing, and had a single success after a string of failures using a 2-meter scale model.[4] In 1994 NASA initiated the Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) program. After a Phase I programme developing proposals from Rockwell International, McDonnell Douglas, and Lockheed Martin, a Phase II contract to develop the X-33 as a demonstrator vehicle was awarded to Lockheed Martin in 1996.[5] At the same time Orbital Sciences was awarded a contract to develop the X-34, an air-launched hypersonic research vehicle.[5] The goals of the RLV program were:[5] $1 billion was spent through 1999 with about 80 percent coming from NASA and additional money contributed by the industry partners.[5] The goal was to have a first flight by March 1999, and to have the VentureStar, the operational reusable space vehicle, flying in 2006.[5] .. to build a vehicle that takes days, not months, to turn around; dozens, not thousands, of people to operate; with launch costs that are a tenth of what they are now. Our goal is a reusable launch vehicle that will cut the cost of getting a pound of payload to orbit from $10,000 to $1,000. — D. Goldin NASA administrator on the RLV program[5] The program was cancelled in February 2001.[6] Construction of the prototype was some 85% assembled with 96% of the parts and the launch facility 100%[7] complete when the program was canceled by NASA in 2001, after a long series of technical difficulties including flight instability and excess weight. In particular, the composite liquid hydrogen fuel tank failed during testing in November 1999. The tank was constructed of honeycomb composite walls and internal structures to reduce its weight. A lighter tank was needed for the craft to demonstrate necessary technologies for single-stage-to-orbit operations. A hydrogen fueled SSTO craft's mass fraction requires that the weight of the vehicle without fuel be 10% of the fully fueled weight. This would allow a vehicle to fly to low Earth orbit without the need for the sort of external boosters and fuel tanks used by the Space Shuttle. But, after the composite tank failed on the test stand during fueling and pressure tests, NASA came to the conclusion that the technology of the time was simply not advanced enough for such a design. While the composite tank walls themselves were lighter, the hydrogen tank shape necessary to fit inside the aerodynamic mouldline resulted in complex joints increasing the total mass of the composite tank to above that of an aluminum-based tank, and too heavy for an SSTO vehicle.[8] NASA had invested $922 million in the project before cancellation, and Lockheed Martin a further $357 million. Due to changes in the space launch business—including the challenges faced by companies such as Globalstar, Teledesic, and Iridium and the resulting drop in the anticipated number of commercial satellite launches per year, Lockheed Martin concluded that continuing development of the X-33 privately without government support would not be profitable.[citation needed] In 2004 Northrop Grumman successfully built and tested a simple cylindrical composite cryogenic hydrogen tank as part of early work for the Constellation program.[9] Through the use of the lifting body shape, composite multi-lobed liquid fuel tanks, and the aerospike engine, NASA and Lockheed Martin hoped to test fly a craft that would demonstrate the viability of a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) design. A spacecraft capable of reaching orbit in a single stage would not require external fuel tanks or boosters to reach low Earth orbit. Doing away with the need for \"staging\" with launch vehicles, such as with the Shuttle and the Apollo rockets, would lead to an inherently more reliable and safer space launch vehicle. While the X-33 would not approach airplane-like safety, the X-33 would attempt to demonstrate 0.997 reliability, or 3 mishaps out of 1,000 launches, which would be an order of magnitude more reliable than the Space Shuttle. The 15 planned experimental X-33 flights could only begin this statistical evaluation. The uncrewed craft would have been launched vertically from a specially designed facility constructed on Edwards Air Force Base,[7] and landed horizontally (VTHL) on a runway at the end of its mission. Initial sub-orbital test flights were planned from Edwards AFB to Dugway Proving Grounds southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. Once those test flights were completed, further flight tests were to be conducted from Edwards AFB to Malmstrom AFB in Great Falls, Montana, to gather more complete data on aircraft heating and engine performance at higher speeds and altitudes.[citation needed] On July 2, 1996, NASA selected Lockheed Martin Skunk Works of Palmdale, California, to design, build, and test the X-33 experimental vehicle for the RLV program. Lockheed Martin's design concept for the X-33 was selected over competing concepts from Rockwell International and McDonnell Douglas. Rockwell proposed a Space Shuttle-derived design, and McDonnell Douglas proposed a design based on its vertical takeoff and landing (VTVL) DC-XA test vehicle.[citation needed] The uncrewed X-33 was slated to fly 15 suborbital hops to near 75.8 km altitude.[10] It was to be launched upright like a rocket and rather than having a straight flight path it would fly diagonally up for half the flight, reaching extremely high altitudes, and then for the rest of the flight glide back down to a runway. The X-33 was never intended to fly higher than an altitude of 100 km, nor faster than one-half of orbital velocity. Had any successful tests occurred, extrapolation would have been necessary to apply the results to a proposed orbital vehicle.[10] The decision to design and build the X-33 grew out of an internal NASA study titled \"Access to Space\".[11] Unlike other space transport studies, \"Access to Space\" was to result in the design and construction of a vehicle. Based on the X-33 experience shared with NASA, Lockheed Martin hoped to make the business case for a full-scale SSTO RLV, called VentureStar, that would be developed and operated through commercial means. The intention was that rather than operate space transport systems as it has with the Space Shuttle, NASA would instead look to private industry to operate the reusable launch vehicle and NASA would purchase launch services from the commercial launch provider. Thus, the X-33 was not only about honing space flight technologies, but also about successfully demonstrating the technology required to make a commercial reusable launch vehicle possible.[citation needed] The VentureStar was to be the first commercial aircraft to fly into space. The VentureStar was intended for long inter-continental flights and supposed to be in service by 2012, but this project was never funded or begun.[citation needed] General characteristics Performance After the cancellation in 2001, engineers were able to make a working liquid-oxygen tank from carbon-fiber composite.[12] Tests showed that composites were feasible materials for liquid-oxygen tanks[13] On September 7, 2004, Northrop Grumman and NASA engineers unveiled a liquid-hydrogen tank made of carbon-fiber composite material that had demonstrated the ability for repeated fuelings and simulated launch cycles.[14] Northrop Grumman concluded that these successful tests have enabled the development and refinement of new manufacturing processes that will allow the company to build large composite tanks without an autoclave; and design and engineering development of conformal fuel tanks appropriate for use on a single-stage-to-orbit vehicle.[15] Five companies expressed interest and proposed concepts. Of those five Lockheed Martin, Rockwell and McDonnell Douglas were selected for workup into more detailed proposals.[16] Rockwell proposed a Space Shuttle-derived design.[17] It would have used one Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) and two RL-10-5A engines.[18]: 49  In a subsequent full-scale system to reach orbit Rockwell planned to use six Rocketdyne RS-2100 engines.[18]: 49  McDonnell Douglas featured a design using liquid oxygen/hydrogen bell engines based on its vertical takeoff and landing DC-XA test vehicle.[6] It would have used a single SSME for the main propulsion system.[18]: 47 [19] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v="}
{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning_II_development","title":"Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II development - Wikipedia","content":"Contents Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II development JSF program requirements and selection Design phase Program cost overruns and delays 2006–2011 2011–present Concerns over performance and safety Pentagon−Lockheed Martin relation issues Upgrades Notes References Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II development started in 1995 with the origins of the Joint Strike Fighter program and culminated in the completion of operational testing and start of full-rate production in 2021.[6] The X-35 first flew on 24 October 2000 and the F-35A on 15 December 2006. The F-35 was developed to replace most US fighter jets with variants of one design common to all branches of the military. It was developed in cooperation with a number of foreign partners, and unlike the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, is intended to be available for export. Three variants were designed: the F-35A (conventional take off and landing, CTOL), the F-35B (short-take off and vertical-landing, STOVL), and the F-35C (carrier-based catapult assisted take-off (CATOBAR), CV). Despite being intended to share most of their parts to reduce costs and improve maintenance logistics, by 2017 the design commonality was only 20%.[7] The program received considerable criticism for cost overruns during development and for the total projected cost of the program over the lifetime of the jets. By 2017 the program was expected over its lifetime (until 2070) to cost $406.5 billion for acquisition of the jets and $1.1 trillion for operations and maintenance.[8] A number of design deficiencies were alleged, such as carrying a small internal payload, inferior performance to the aircraft being replaced, particularly the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, and the lack of safety in relying on a single engine, and flaws were noted such as vulnerability of the fuel tank to fire and the propensity for transonic roll-off (TRO or \"wing drop\"). The possible obsolescence of stealth technology was also criticized. The Joint Strike Fighter program was intended to replace the United States military General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet (excluding newer E/F \"Super Hornet\" variants) and McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II tactical fighter and attack aircraft, and meet anticipated performance expectation enhancements covering military requirements up to 2035.[7] Originally planned to keep development, production, and operating costs down, a common design was originally optimistically planned in three variants that would share 80 percent of their parts. However, by April 2017 the variants were sharing at most twenty percent common design:[7] The design goals call for the F-35 to be the premier strike aircraft through 2040 and to be second only to the F-22 Raptor in air supremacy.[9] George Standridge, Vice President of Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, predicted in 2006 that the F-35 would be four times more effective than legacy fighters in air-to-air combat, eight times more effective in air-to-ground combat, and three times more effective in reconnaissance and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses – while having better range and requiring less logistics support and having around the same procurement costs (if development costs are ignored) as legacy fighters.[10] The JSF development contract was signed on 16 November 1996, and the contract for System Development and Demonstration (SDD) was awarded by the Department of Defense (DoD) on 26 October 2001 to Lockheed Martin, whose X-35 beat the Boeing X-32. Although both aircraft met or exceeded requirements, the X-35 design was considered to have less risk and more growth potential.[11] The designation of the new fighter as \"F-35\" is out-of-sequence with standard DoD aircraft numbering,[12] by which it should have been \"F-24\". It came as a surprise even to the company, which had been referring to the aircraft in-house by this expected designation.[13] The development of the F-35 is unusual for a fighter aircraft in that no two-seat trainer versions have been built for any of the variants; advanced flight simulators mean that no trainer versions were deemed necessary.[14] Instead F-16s have been used as bridge trainers between the T-38 and the F-35. The T-X was intended to be used to train future F-35 pilots, but this might succumb to budget pressures in the USAF.[15] Based on wind tunnel testing, Lockheed Martin slightly enlarged its X-35 design into the F-35. The forward fuselage is 5 inches (130 mm) longer to make room for avionics. Correspondingly, the horizontal stabilators were moved 2 inches (51 mm) rearward to retain balance and control. The top surface of the fuselage was raised by 1 inch (25 mm) along the center line. Also, it was decided to increase the size of the F-35B STOVL variant's weapons bay to be common with the other two variants.[11] Manufacturing of parts for the first F-35 prototype airframe began in November 2003.[16] Because the X-35 did not have weapons bays, their addition in the F-35 would cause design changes which would lead to later weight problems.[17][18] The F-35B STOVL variant was in danger of missing performance requirements in 2004 because it weighed too much; reportedly, by 2,200 lb (1,000 kg) or 8%. In response, Lockheed Martin added engine thrust and thinned airframe members, reduced the size of the common weapons bay and vertical stabilizers, rerouted some thrust from the roll-post outlets to the main nozzle, and redesigned the wing-mate joint, portions of the electrical system, and the portion of the aircraft immediately behind the cockpit.[19] Many of the changes were applied to all three variants to maintain high levels of commonality. By September 2004, the weight reduction effort had reduced the aircraft's design weight by 2,700 pounds (1,200 kg),[20] but the redesign cost $6.2 billion and delayed the project by 18 months.[21] On 7 July 2006, the U.S. Air Force, the lead service for the aircraft, officially announced the name of the F-35: Lightning II, in honor of Lockheed's World War II-era twin-propeller Lockheed P-38 Lightning for the United States Army Air Forces and the Cold War-era jet, the English Electric Lightning for the Royal Air Force.[22][a] Lockheed Martin Aeronautics is the prime contractor and performs aircraft final assembly, overall system integration, mission system, and provides forward fuselage, wings and aircraft flight control system. Northrop Grumman provides active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, electro-optical AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System (DAS), Communications, Navigation, Identification (CNI), center fuselage, weapons bay, and arrestor gear. BAE Systems provides the Flight Control Software (FCS1), the electronic warfare systems, crew life support and escape systems, aft fuselage, empennages as well as the horizontal and vertical tails. Alenia will perform final assembly for Italy and, according to an Alenia executive, assembly of all European aircraft with the exception of Turkey and the United Kingdom.[24][25] The F-35 program has seen a great deal of investment in automated production facilities. For example, Handling Specialty produced the wing assembly platforms for Lockheed Martin.[26] On 19 December 2008, Lockheed Martin rolled out the first weight-optimized F-35A, designated AF-1. It was the first F-35 built at full production speed, and is structurally identical to the production F-35As that were delivered starting in 2010.[27] On 5 January 2009, six F-35s had been built, including AF-1; another 13 pre-production test aircraft and four production aircraft were being manufactured.[28] On 6 April 2009, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates proposed speeding up production for the U.S. to buy 2,443 F-35s.[29] The F-35 program has experienced a number of cost overruns and developmental delays. The program's delays have come under fire from the U.S. Congress and some U.S. Department of Defense officials. The program has undergone a number of reassessments and changes since 2006. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) warned in March 2006 that excessive concurrency (\"an overlap of flight testing and initial production\"[30]) might result in expensive refits for several hundred F-35 aircraft that are planned for production before design testing is completed.[31] In 2010, acquisition chief Ashton Carter issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum restructuring the F-35 program.[32] In November 2010, the GAO found that \"Managing an extensive, still-maturing global network of suppliers adds another layer of complexity to producing aircraft efficiently and on-time\" and that \"due to the extensive amount of testing still to be completed, the program could be required to make alterations to its production processes, changes to its supplier base, and costly retrofits to produced and fielded aircraft, if problems are discovered\".[33] USAF budget data in 2010, along with other sources, projected the F-35 to have a flyaway cost from US$89 million to US$200 million over the planned production run.[34][35] In February 2011, the Pentagon put a price of $207.6 million on each of the 32 aircraft to be acquired in FY2012, rising to $304.16 million (a total acquisition cost of $9.7 billion for 32 aircraft) if its share of research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) spending is included.[36][37] On 21 April 2009, media reports, citing Pentagon sources, said that during 2007 and 2008, spies downloaded several terabytes of data related to the F-35's design and electronics systems, potentially compromising the aircraft and aiding the development of defense systems against it.[38] Lockheed Martin rejected suggestions that the project was compromised, stating it \"does not believe any classified information had been stolen\".[39] Other sources suggested that the incident caused both hardware and software redesigns to be more resistant to cyber attack.[40] In March 2012, BAE Systems was reported to be the target of cyber espionage. BAE Systems refused to comment on the report, although they did state, \"[Our] own cyber security capability can detect, prevent and rectify such attacks\".[41] On 9 November 2009, Ashton Carter, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, acknowledged that the Pentagon \"joint estimate team\" (JET) had found possible future cost and schedule overruns in the project and that he would be holding meetings to attempt to avoid these.[42] On 1 February 2010, Gates removed the JSF Program Manager, U.S. Marine Corps Major General David Heinz, and withheld $614 million in payments to Lockheed Martin because of program costs and delays.[43][44] On 11 March 2010, a report from the Government Accountability Office to United States Senate Committee on Armed Services projected the overall unit cost of an F-35A to be $113 million in \"today's money\".[45] In 2010, Pentagon officials disclosed that the F-35 program had exceeded its original cost estimates by more than 50 percent.[46] An internal Pentagon report critical of the JSF project stated that \"affordability is no longer embraced as a core pillar\". In 2010, Lockheed Martin expected they would be able to reduce costs projected by government estimators by 20 percent.[47] On 24 March 2010, Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense, in testimony before Congress, declared the cost overruns and delays \"unacceptable\", characterizing previous cost and schedule estimates as \"overly rosy\". Gates insisted the F-35 would become \"the backbone of U.S. air combat for the next generation\" and informed Congress that he had extended the development period by an additional 13 months and budgeted $3 billion more for the testing program, while slowing down production.[48] In August 2010, Lockheed Martin announced delays in resolving a \"wing-at-mate overlap\" production problem, which would slow initial production.[49] In November 2010, as part of a cost-cutting measure, the co-chairs of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform suggested cancelling the F-35B and halving orders for F-35As and F-35Cs.[50][51][52] Air Force Magazine reported that \"Pentagon officials\" were considering canceling the F-35B because its short range meant that the forward bases or amphibious ships from which it would operate would be in range of hostile tactical ballistic missiles.[53] Lockheed Martin consultant Loren B. Thompson said that this ″rumor″ was a result of the usual tensions between the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, and there was no alternative other than the F-35B as a replacement for AV-8B Harrier II.[54] He also confirmed that there were further delays and cost increases due to technical problems with the aircraft and software, blaming most of the delays and extra costs on redundant flight tests.[55] In November 2010, the Center for Defense Information expected that the F-35 program would be restructured, resulting in an additional year of delay and increasing the cost by another $5 billion.[56] On 5 November 2010, the Block 1 software flew for the first time on BF-4.[57] As of the end of 2010, it was said that only 15% of the software remained to be written, but this was reported to include the most difficult sections such as data fusion.[58] In 2011, it was revealed that actually, only 50% of the estimated eight million lines of code needed had been written and that, according to the newest schedule, it would take another six years to complete the software.[59] By 2012, the total estimated lines of code for the entire program (onboard and offboard) had grown from the previous year's estimate of 8 million lines to 24 million lines.[60] In 2011, the program head and Commander of the Naval Air Systems Command, Vice Admiral David Venlet, confirmed that the concurrency (testing and production at the same time) built into the program \"was a miscalculation\".[61] This was said during a contract dispute, in which the Pentagon insisted that Lockheed Martin help cover the costs of applying fixes found during testing of aircraft already produced.[62] Lockheed Martin objected that the cost sharing posed an uninsurable, unbounded risk that the company could not cover, and later responded that the \"concurrency costs for F-35 continue to reduce\".[63][64] The Senate Armed Services Committee strongly backed the Pentagon position.[65] However, in December 2011, Lockheed Martin accepted a cost sharing agreement.[66] The Aerospace Industries Association warned that such changes would force them to anticipate cost overruns in the future when bidding on contracts.[67] As of 2012, problems found during flight testing were expected to continue to lead to higher levels of engineering changes through 2019.[68] The total additional cost for concurrency in the program is around $1.3 billion.[69] By the next year the cost had grown to $1.7 billion.[70] In January 2011, Defense Secretary Robert Gates expressed the Pentagon's frustration with the rising costs of the F-35 program when he said, \"The culture of endless money that has taken hold must be replaced by a culture of restraint\". Focusing his attention on the troubled F-35B, Gates ordered \"a two-year probation\", saying it \"should be canceled\" if corrections are unsuccessful.[71] Gates had previously stated his support for the program.[72] Some private analysts had said that the F-35 program was becoming a money pit.[73] Gates' successor, Leon Panetta, ended the F-35B's probation on 20 January 2012, stating \"The STOVL variant has made—I believe and all of us believe—sufficient progress\".[74] In February 2011, former Pentagon manager Paul G. Kaminski said that the lack of a complete test plan would add five years to the JSF program.[75] Initial operating capability (IOC) will be determined by software development rather than by hardware production or pilot training.[76] As of May 2013[update], the USMC plans to have Initial Operating Capability by \"mid-2015\" for the F-35B, using Block 2B software, which gives basic air-to-air and air-to-ground capability. It is reported that the USAF plans to push ahead, expecting to have Initial Operating Capability with the F-35A in mid-2016, using Block 3I software, rather than waiting for the full-capability Block 3F software, which is expected to be available by mid-2017. The F-35C will not enter service with the USN until mid-2018.[77] The $56.4 billion development project for the aircraft should be completed in 2018 when the Block 5 configuration is expected to be delivered, several years late and considerably over budget.[78] Delays in the F-35 program may lead to a \"fighter gap\" with the United States and other countries lacking sufficient fighter aircraft to meet their requirements.[79] Israel may seek to buy second-hand F-15Es,[80] while Australia has considered buying additional F/A-18 Super Hornets in the face of F-35 delays.[81] In May 2011, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer, Ashton Carter, said that the latest price estimate of $133 million per aircraft was not affordable.[82] In 2011, The Economist warned that the F-35 was in danger of slipping into a \"death spiral\", where increasing per-aircraft costs would lead to cuts in number of aircraft ordered, leading to further cost increases and further cuts in orders.[83] Later that year, four aircraft were cut from the fifth \"Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP)\" order because of cost overruns.[84] In 2012, a further two aircraft were cut.[85] Lockheed Martin acknowledged that the slowing of purchases would increase costs.[86] David Van Buren, U.S. Air Force acquisition chief, said that Lockheed Martin needed to reduce manufacturing capacity to match the reduced market for their aircraft.[87] However, the company said that the slowdown in American orders would free up capacity, which could be diverted to meet urgent, short-term needs of foreign partners for replacement fighters.[88] Air Force Secretary Michael Donley said that no more money was available and that future price increases would be met with cuts in the number of aircraft ordered.[89] Later that month, the Pentagon reported that costs had risen another 4.3 percent, in part because of production delays.[90] In 2012, the purchase of six out of 31 aircraft was conditioned on progress of development and testing.[91] In 2013, Bogdan repeated that no more money was available, but that he hoped to avoid the death spiral.[92] In 2014 it was reported that another eight aircraft would be cut from the following year's order.[93] Japan warned that it may halt its purchase of the F-35 if the cost per aircraft increases and Canada has indicated it has not yet committed to purchase the aircraft.[94][95] The United States is now projected to spend an estimated $323 billion for development and procurement of the F-35, making it the most expensive defense program ever.[96] Testifying before a Canadian parliamentary committee in 2011, Rear Admiral Arne Røksund of Norway estimated that his country's 52 F-35 fighter jets will cost $769 million each over their operational lifetime.[97] In 2012, the total life-cycle cost for the entire U.S. fleet was estimated at US$1.51 trillion over a 50-year life, or $618 million per plane.[98] In hopes of reducing this high lifetime cost, the USAF is considering reducing Lockheed Martin's role in contractor logistics support.[99] The company has responded that the Pentagon's lifetime cost estimate includes future costs beyond its control, such as USAF reorganizations and yet-to-be-specified upgrades.[100] Delays have also negatively affected the program's worldwide supply chain and partner organizations as well.[101] In 2012, General Norton A. Schwartz decried the \"foolishness\" of reliance on computer models to arrive at the final design of aircraft before flight testing has found the problems that require changes in design.[102] In 2013, JSF project team leader, USAF Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, said that \"A large amount of concurrency, that is, beginning production long before your design is stable and long before you've found problems in test, creates downstream issues where now you have to go back and retrofit airplanes and make sure the production line has those fixes in them. And that drives complexity and cost\".[103] Bogdan remarked on the improvement in the program ever since Lockheed Martin was forced to assume some of the financial risks.[104] In 2012, in order to avoid further delays that would result from design changes, the U.S. DoD accepted a reduced combat radius for the F-35A and a longer takeoff run for the F-35B.[105][106] As a result, the F-35B's estimated combat radius was reduced by 15 percent.[107] In a meeting in Sydney, Australia in March 2012, the United States pledged to eight partner nations that there would be no more program delays.[108] In May 2012, Lockheed Martin Chief Executive Bob Stevens complained that the Defense Department's requirements for cost data were themselves driving up program costs.[109] Stevens also said that a strike by union employees might result in failure to meet that year's production target of 29 F-35s.[110] Striking workers questioned the quality of work done by temporary replacements, noting that even their own work had been cited for \"inattention to production quality\", resulting in a 16% rework rate.[111] The workers went on strike to protect pensions, the cost of which had been the subject of negotiations with the Department of Defense over orders for the next batch of aircraft.[112] These same pension costs were cited by Fitch in their downgrade of the outlook for Lockheed Martin's stock price.[113] Stevens said that while he hoped to bring down program costs, the industrial base was not capable of meeting the government's cost expectations, given the current number of aircraft on order.[114][115] According to a June 2012 Government Accountability Office report, the F-35's unit cost had almost doubled, with an increase of 93% over the program's original, 2001 baseline cost estimates.[116] In 2012, Lockheed Martin reportedly feared that the tighter policies of the Obama administration regarding award fees would reduce their profits by $500 million over the coming five years.[117] This in fact occurred in 2012, when the Pentagon withheld the maximum $47 million allowed, for the company's failure to certify its program for tracking project costs and schedules.[118] The GAO also faulted the USAF and USN for not fully planning for the costs of extending legacy F-16 and F-18 fleets to cover the delay in acquiring the F-35.[119] Because of cost-cutting measures, the U.S. Government asserts that the \"flyaway\" cost (including engines) has been dropping. The U.S. Government estimates that in 2020 an \"F-35 will cost some $85m each, or less than half of the cost of the initial units delivered in 2009. Adjusted to today’s dollars, the 2020 price would be $75m each\".[120] In 2013, Lockheed Martin began to lay off workers at the Fort Worth, Texas plant where the F-35s were being assembled.[121] They said that revised estimates indicated that the costs of refitting the 187 aircraft built by the time testing concludes in 2016 would be lower than feared.[122] The GAO's Michael Sullivan said that the company had failed to get an early start on systems engineering and had not understood the requirements or the technologies involved at the program's start.[123] The Pentagon vowed to continue funding the program during budget sequestration if possible.[124] It was feared that the U.S. budget sequestration in 2013 could slow development of critical software[125] and the Congress ordered another study to be made on the software development delays.[126] As of 2014, software development remained the \"number one technical challenge\" for the F-35.[127] In June 2013, Frank Kendall, Pentagon acquisition, technology and logistics chief, declared \"major advances\" had been made in the F-35 program over the last three years and that he intended to approve production-rate increases in September. Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, program executive officer, reported far better communications between government and vendor managers, and that negotiations over Lot 6 and 7 talks were moving fast. It was also stated that operating costs had been better understood since training started. He predicted \"we can make a substantial dent in projections\" of operating costs.[128] In July 2013, further doubt was cast on the latest production schedule, with further software delays and continuing sensor, display and wing buffet problems.[129] In August it was revealed that the Pentagon was weighing cancellation of the program as one possible response to the budget sequestration[130][131] and the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense voted to cut advance procurement for the fighter.[132] On August 21, 2013, C-Span reported that Congressional Quarterly and the Government Accountability Office were indicating the \"total estimated program cost now is $400 billion, nearly twice the initial cost\". The current investment was documented as approximately $50 billion. The projected $316 billion cost in development and procurement was estimated through 2037 at an average of $12.6 billion per year. These were confirmed by Steve O'Bryan, Vice President of Lockheed Martin, on the same date.[133] In 2013, a RAND study found that during development, the three different versions had drifted so far apart from each other, that having a single base design might have come to be more expensive than if the three services had simply built entirely different aircraft, each tailored to their own requirements.[134] On 10 April 2017 Bloomberg Businessweek reported that the total expenditures for the F-35 program would approach $1 trillion.[135] In 2014, the airframe cost went below $100 million for the first time, and the Air Force expected unit costs to fall.[136] A 2014 Center for International Policy study cast doubt on the number of indirect jobs created by the program, which has been a key selling point for the F-35 to Congress. Lockheed stood by their job numbers and said that their accounting was in line with industry norms.[137] A January 2014 report by J. Michael Gilmore said that new software delays could delay Block 2B release by 13 months.[138] This estimate was reduced to 4 months in the DOTE report from November 2014.[139] The F-35 program office considered software to be the top technical risk to the program. The USMC was maintaining their expectation of an Initial Operational Capability by July 2015.[140] In 2014, U.S. Senator John McCain blamed cost increases in the program on \"cronyism\".[141] In 2014, the GAO found that the F-35 fleet would have operating costs 79% higher than the aircraft it was to replace.[142] In 2014, the FY2015 Selected Acquisition Report stated that the program cost had increased 43% from 2001, with Program Acquisition Unit Cost up 68% and Unit Recurring Flyaway up 41%.[143] The F-35A's cost per flying hour in BY2012 dollars is $32,500 while the F-16C/D is $25,500, but each F-35A is expected to fly only 250 hours a year, compared to the F-16's 316 hours a year, resulting in the same yearly operating cost.[143][144] In July 2014, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and BAE Systems announced they would invest a combined $170 million in the program[clarification needed], which was anticipated to result in savings of over $10 million per aircraft. This initiative was said to have set the project on track for an $80M (including engine) price tag per aircraft (F-35A) by 2018, when full production is scheduled to begin.[145] The December 2014 Selected Acquisition Report listed a cost decrease of $7.5 billion against a program cost of $391.1 billion ($320 billion in 2012 dollars). Lockheed Martin also stated that there would be an estimated decrease of nearly $60 billion to the operations and support costs.[146] In December 2015, the FY2017 Selected Acquisition Report had revised the F-35A's cost per flying hour in BY2012 dollars to $29,806, in comparison with the F-16C/D's antecedent of $25,541, also in BY2012 dollars. This was a result of a decrease in the assumed cost per gallon of JP-8 fuel, a decrease in the fuel burn rate for the F-35A variant and a revised cost estimating relationship for hardware modifications.[147] The 2015 DoD annual report stated that the current schedule to complete System Development and Demonstration (SDD) and enter Initial Operational Testing and Evaluation (IOT&E) by August 2017 was unrealistic, instead the program would likely not finish Block 3F development and flight testing prior to January 2018. Based on those projected completion dates for Block 3F developmental testing, IOT&E would not start earlier than August 2018.[148][149] The Block 3I software was intended to be a revision of the Block 2B software to run on the updated Integrated Core Processor.[150] Unfortunately, it resulted in a timing misalignment that reduced stability, requiring reboots in flight.[151] By May 2016 the software had been improved to the point where it only crashed every 15 hours.[152] Reboots were required over a third of the time for ground cold starts.[153] The following month saw 88 successful sorties untroubled by the stability bug.[154] A Lockheed Martin press release points to USAF simulations regarding the F-35's air-to-air performance against adversaries described as \"4th generation\" fighters, in which it states the F-35 is \"400 percent\" more effective. Major General Charles R. Davis, USAF, the F-35 program executive officer, has stated that the \"F-35 enjoys a significant Combat Loss Exchange Ratio advantage over the current and future air-to-air threats, to include Sukhois\".[155] In September 2008, in reference to the original plan to fit the F-35 with only two air-to-air missiles (internally), Major Richard Koch, chief of USAF Air Combat Command's advanced air dominance branch is reported to have said that \"I wake up in a cold sweat at the thought of the F-35 going in with only two air-dominance weapons\".[156] The Norwegians have been briefed on a plan to equip the F-35 with six AIM-120D missiles by 2019.[157] Former RAND author John Stillion has written of the F-35A's air-to-air combat performance that it \"can't turn, can't climb, can't run\"; Lockheed Martin test pilot Jon Beesley has stated that in an air-to-air configuration the F-35 has almost as much thrust as weight and a flight control system that allows it to be fully maneuverable even at a 50-degree angle of attack.[158][159] Consultant to Lockheed Martin Loren B. Thompson has said that the \"electronic edge F-35 enjoys over every other tactical aircraft in the world may prove to be more important in future missions than maneuverability\".[160] A senior U.S. defense official was quoted as saying that the F-35 will be \"the most stealthy, sophisticated and lethal tactical fighter in the sky\", and added \"Quite simply, the F-15 will be no match for the F-35\".[161] After piloting the aircraft, RAF Squadron Leader Steve Long said that, over its existing aircraft, the F-35 will give \"the RAF and Navy a quantum leap in airborne capability\".[162] In November 2009, Jon Schreiber, head of F-35 international affairs program for the Pentagon, said that the U.S. will not share the software code for the F-35 with its allies.[163] The US plans to set up a reprogramming facility that will develop JSF software and distribute it to allies.[164] In 2014 in order to deal with capacity issues in the creation of mission data packages at the Air Combat Command reprogramming lab at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., plans were announced to open additional mission data labs to customize mission data packages with terrain and enemy threat information for different regions and partner nation needs.[165] DARPA is working on the Adaptive Radar Countermeasures (ARC) project to provide protection in real time for previously unknown threat radars.[166] In 2011, Canadian politicians raised the issue of the safety of the F-35's reliance on a single engine (as opposed to a twin-engine configuration, which provides a backup in case of an engine failure). Canada, and other operators, had previous experience with a high accident rate with the single-engine Lockheed CF-104 Starfighter with many accidents related to engine failures. When asked what would happen if the F-35's single engine fails in the far north, Defence Minister Peter MacKay stated \"It won’t\".[167] In November 2011, a Pentagon study team identified 13 areas of concern that remained to be addressed in the F-35.[168][169] In May 2012, Michael Auslin of the American Enterprise Institute questioned the capability of the F-35 to engage modern air defenses.[170] In July 2012, the Pentagon awarded Lockheed Martin $450 million to improve the F-35 electronic warfare systems and incorporate Israeli systems.[171] In a negative assessment of the Joint Strike Fighter, the think tank Air Power Australia declared that the Joint Strike Fighter is not designed to perform air superiority roles and also is not adapted to performing the long-range penetration strike role filled by previous Australian aircraft like the General Dynamics F-111C. Critically, they also stated that the F-35's \"intended survivability and lethality are mismatched against the operational environment in which the aircraft is intended to be used\".[172] In June 2012, Australia's Air Vice Marshal Osley responded to Air Power Australia's criticisms by saying \"Air Power Australia (Kopp and Goon) claim that the F-35 will not be competitive in 2020 and that Air Power Australia's criticisms mainly center around F-35's aerodynamic performance and stealth capabilities\". Osley continued, \"these are inconsistent with years of detailed analysis that has been undertaken by Defence, the JSF program office, Lockheed Martin, the U.S. services and the eight other partner nations. While aircraft developments, such as the Sukhoi Su-57 or the Chengdu J-20, as argued by Airpower Australia, show that threats we could potentially face are becoming increasingly sophisticated, there is nothing new regarding development of these aircraft to change Defence's assessment\". He then said that he thinks that the Air Power Australia's \"analysis is basically flawed through incorrect assumptions and a lack of knowledge of the classified F-35 performance information\".[173] A report released in 2013 stated that flaws in the fuel tank and fueldraulic (fuel-based hydraulic) systems have left it considerably more vulnerable to lightning strikes and other fire sources, including enemy fire, than previously revealed, especially at lower altitudes.[174] The restriction on blue skies flights was subsequently removed in 2015.[175] This report updated a separate report from 2010, in which Lockheed Martin spokesman John Kent said that adding fire-suppression systems would offer \"very small\" improvement to survivability.[176] The same 2010 report also noted performance degradation of the three variants; the sustained turn rates had been reduced to 4.6 g for the F-35A, 4.5 g for the F-35B, and 5.0 g for the F-35C. The acceleration performance of all three variants was also downgraded, with the F-35C taking 43 seconds longer than an F-16 to accelerate from Mach 0.8 to Mach 1.2; this was judged by several fighter pilots to be a lower performance level than expected from a fourth generation fighter.[177] On 30 August 2013, it was reported that the F-35B and F-35C models take several complex maneuvers in order to \"accelerate\" to their top speed of Mach 1.6, which consumed almost all of the onboard fuel.[178] The F-35 program office is reconsidering addition of previously removed safety equipment.[179] In 2012, Lockheed Martin program manager Tom Burbage said that while the relatively large cross-sectional area of the fighter that was required by the internal weapons bays gave it a disadvantage against fourth generation fighters that were operating in a clean configuration, the F-35 armed with weapons carried internally had the advantage over fighters carrying their weapons outside the aircraft.[180] In March 2013, USAF test pilots, flying with pre-operational software that did not utilize the all-aspect infrared AAQ-37 DAS sensor, noted a lack of visibility from the F-35 cockpit during evaluation flights, which would get them consistently shot down in combat. Defense spending analyst Winslow Wheeler concluded from flight evaluation reports that the F-35A \"is flawed beyond redemption\";[181] in response, program manager Bogdan suggested that pilots worried about being shot down should fly cargo aircraft instead.[182] The same report found (in addition to the usual problems with the aircraft listed above): The JPO responded that more experienced pilots would be able to safely operate the aircraft and that procedures would improve over time.[184] Even in the final \"3F\" software version, the F-35 will lack ROVER, in spite of having close air support as one of its primary missions.[185] In 2014, David Axe stated design flaws related to its single-engine configuration could vex the F-35 for decades to come, forcing the Pentagon to suspend flying too often for the majority of its fighter fleet.[186] In November 2014, China unveiled the portable JY-26 Skywatch-U UHF 3-D long-range surveillance radar system, specifically designed to defeat stealth aircraft like the F-35.[187] Responding to a reporter's question about the High-Frequency radar threat General Welsh said \"while we may have a new radar developed that allows an acquisition radar to see an airplane, that doesn't mean you can pass the track off to a radar that will then guide a weapon to be able to destroy the airplane. As long as we break the kill chain sometime between when you arrive in the battle space and when the enemy weapon approaches your airplane, you're successful at using stealth\".[188] A 2014 Pentagon report found these issues: A 2015 Pentagon report found these issues:[189] Three different types of data \"massaging\" are identified in the DOT&E report:[190] moving failures from one category to another, less important one; ignoring repetitive failures, thus inflating numbers of failure-free hours; and improper scoring of reliability.[191] Maintenance problems were determined to be so severe that the F-35 is only able to fly twice a week. To address the issue of wing drop and buffet maneuvering, the required control law modifications will reduce the maneuverability of the F-35, \"only exacerbating the plane’s performance problems in this area\". The F-35C's wing drop problem is \"worse than other variants\". Testing to investigate the impact of buffet and transonic roll-off (TRO or \"wing drop\") on the helmet-mounted display and offensive and defensive maneuvering found that \"buffet affected display symbology, and would have the greatest impact in scenarios where a pilot was maneuvering to defeat a missile shot\". Buffeting also degrades the gyroscopes in the inertial platforms which are essential for flight control, navigation, and weapons aiming. DOT&E explained that this was an ongoing issue: \"In heavy buffet conditions, which occur between 20 and 26 degrees angle of attack, faults occurred in the inertial measurement units (IMUs) in the aircraft that degraded the flight control system (two of three flight control channels become disabled), requiring a flight abort\".[192] In early 2015 the AF-2 F-35A, the primary flight sciences loads and flutter evaluation aircraft, was flown by Lockheed Martin F-35 site lead test pilot David \"Doc\" Nelson in air-to-air combat maneuvers against F-16s for the first time and, based on the results of these and earlier flight-envelope evaluations, said the aircraft can be cleared for greater agility as a growth option. AF-2 was the first F-35 to be flown to 9g+ and −3g, and to roll at design-load factor. Departure/spin resistance was also proven during high angle-of-attack (AOA) testing which eventually went as high as 110 deg. AOA. \"When we did the first dogfight in January, they said, ‘you have no limits,’\" says Nelson. \"It was loads monitoring, so they could tell if we ever broke something. It was a confidence builder for the rest of the fleet because there is no real difference structurally between AF-2 and the rest of the airplanes\". \"Pilots really like maneuverability, and the fact that the aircraft recovers so well from a departure allows us to say [to the designers of the flight control system laws], ‘you don’t have to clamp down so tight,’\" says Nelson.[193] With the full flight envelope now opened to an altitude of 50,000 ft, speeds of Mach 1.6/700 KCAS and loads of 9 g, test pilots also say improvements to the flight control system have rendered the transonic roll-off (TRO) issue tactically irrelevant. Highlighted as a \"program concern\" in the Defense Department's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) 2014 report, initial flight tests showed that all three F-35 variants experienced some form of wing drop in high-speed turns associated with asymmetrical movements of shock waves. However, TRO \"has evolved into a non-factor\", says Nelson, who likens the effect to a momentary \"tug\" on one shoulder harness. \"You have to pull high-g to even find it\". The roll-off phenomena exhibits itself as \"less than 10 deg./sec. for a fraction of a second. We have been looking for a task it affects and we can’t find one\".[193] In July 2015, Lockheed Martin confirmed the authenticity of a leaked report showing the F-35 to be less maneuverable than an older F-16D with wing tanks.[194][195] The pilot who flew the mission reported inferior energy maneuverability, a limited pitch rate and flying qualities that were \"not intuitive or favorable\" in a major part of the air-combat regime gave the F-16 the tactical advantage. In general the high AoA capabilities of the jet could not be used in an effective way without significantly reducing follow-on maneuvering potential. In an interview with CBC Radio broadcast 2 July 2015, military journalist David Axe claimed to have read the leaked report and stated: \"Against a determined foe, the F-35 is in very big trouble\".[196] However, the F-35 used was a flight test aircraft with a restricted flight envelope and lacked some features present on the operational aircraft.[197] The Pentagon, JPO, and defense analysts have defended the F-35's utility in spite of the report's assertion that it lacks maneuverability by saying it was designed primarily to disrupt the kill chain of advanced air defenses while the F-22 would handle close-in dogfighting, it has advanced sensor and information fusion capabilities to detect and engage enemy aircraft at long ranges before it can be seen and merged with, and that most air combat in recent decades has focused on sensors and weapons that achieved long-range kills rather than close combat.[198][199] The report's conclusions and recommendations noted loads remained below limits, implying there may be more maneuverability available to the airframe. There were five recommendations: increase pitch rate and available Nz (Normal Acceleration g) to provide the pilot with more maneuverability options given the inherent energy deficit; consider increasing alpha onset to also help offset the energy maneuverability deficit; consider increasing the beginning of the high AoA blended region to 30 degrees or greater to make high AoA maneuvering more predictable and intuitive; consider increasing pilot yaw rate to remove the gradual sluggish yaw response; and improve HMD Boresight performance to account for dynamic maneuvers and consider improving rearward visibility by creating more space for helmet motion.[194][200] On 14 April 2016 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on the $16.7 billion Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) expressing concerns that a failure in the logistics system, which serves as the \"brains\" of the F-35, could ground the entire fleet because it lacked a back-up for processing data. ALIS supports everything from the plane's operations, pilot scheduling, mission planning and supply chain management to maintenance; it is therefore one of the three major components of the jet, along with the airframe and engine. GAO said one of the biggest concerns raised by 120 F-35 pilots, maintenance staff, contractors and program officials interviewed for the report was the lack of a redundant system for processing ALIS data. GAO noted \"DOD is aware of risks that could affect ALIS but does not have a plan to prioritize and address them in a holistic manner to ensure that ALIS is fully functional as the F-35 program approaches key milestones – including Air Force and Navy initial operational capability declarations in 2016 and 2018, respectively, and the start of the program’s full-rate production in 2019\". A Pentagon-commissioned study from 2013 concluded that any delays or problems with ALIS could add $20 billion to the F-35 program cost.[201][202] In a 2019 report, the DOT&E found that data provided by ALIS is often incorrect, leading to fighters being erroneously categorized as non-mission capable.[203] In May 2016, Flightglobal reported that new Block 3i software was finally installed, improving reliability over earlier Block 3 software. With early Block 3 software, it was reported that aircraft had to be shut down and rebooted or a sensor or radar reset \"every 4 hours\", which was considered an \"unacceptable\" rate. According to Flightglobal, \"F-35 programme director Lt Gen Christopher Bogdan told Congress...that a failure rate of once every 8-10h or greater would be more acceptable, and recent fixes now seem to have achieved that goal\".[204] In September 2012, the Pentagon criticized, quite publicly, Lockheed Martin's performance on the F-35 program and stated that it would not bail out the program again if problems with the plane's systems, particularly the helmet-mounted display, were not resolved. The deputy F-35 program manager said that the government's relationship with the company was the \"worst I've ever seen\" in many years of working on complex acquisition programs. Air Force Secretary Michael Donley told reporters the Pentagon had no more money to pour into the program after three costly restructurings in recent years. He said the department was done with major restructuring and that there was no further flexibility or tolerance for that approach. This criticism followed a \"very painful\" 7 September review that focused on an array of ongoing program challenges. Lockheed Martin responded with a brief statement saying it would continue to work with the F-35 program office to deliver the new fighter.[205] On 28 September 2012, the Pentagon announced that the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter support program would become an open competition. They invited companies to participate in a two-day forum on 14–15 November for possible opportunities to compete for work managing the supply chain of the aircraft. Their reason is to reduce F-35 life-cycle costs by creating competition within the program and to refine its acquisition strategy and evaluate alternatives that will deliver the best value, long-term F-35 sustainment solution. This could be hazardous to Lockheed Martin, the current prime contractor for sustainment of all three variants, and selection of another company could reduce their revenues.[206] In 2013, the officer in charge of the program blamed Lockheed Martin and Pratt & Whitney for gouging the government on costs, instead of focusing on the long-term future of the program.[207] In 2014, Lockheed was reported to be having problems with build quality, including one aircraft with a valve installed backwards and another with gaps in the stealth coating.[208] In 2012 Lockheed Martin's development roadmap extended until 2021, and included a Block 6 engine improvement in 2019. The aircraft are expected to be upgraded throughout their operational lives.[209] In September 2013, Northrop Grumman revealed the development of a company-funded Directional Infrared Counter Measures system in anticipation of a requirement to protect the F-35 from heat-seeking missiles. A laser jammer is expected to be part of the F-35 Block 5 upgrade; it must meet low-observability (LO) requirements and fit in the F-35's restricted space. Called the Threat Nullification Defensive Resource (ThNDR), it is to have a small, powerful laser, beam steering and LO window, use liquid cooling, and fit alongside the distributed aperture system (DAS) to provide spherical coverage with minimal changes; the DAS would provide missile warning and cue the jam head.[210] Combat capabilities of the F-35 are made possible through software increments to advance technical abilities. Block 2A software enhanced simulated weapons, data link capabilities, and early fused sensor integration. Block 2B software enables the F-35 to provide basic close air support with certain JDAMs and the 500 lb GBU-12 Paveway II, as well as fire the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The Air Force is to declare the F-35 initially operational with Block 3i software. Full operational capability will come from Block 3F software; Block 3F enhances its ability to suppress enemy air defenses and enables the Lightning II to deploy the 500 lb JDAM, the GBU-53/B SDB II, and the AIM-9X Sidewinder. Block 4 software will increase the weapons envelope of the F-35 and is made to counter air defenses envisioned to be encountered past the 2040s. Block 4 upgrades will be broken into two increments; Block 4A in 2021 and Block 4B in 2023. This phase will also include usage of weaponry unique to British and other European countries who will operate Lightning II.[211] Lockheed has offered the potential of \"Higher Definition Video, longer range target detection and identification, Video Data Link, and Infrared (IR) Marker and Pointer\" for the EOTS in future upgrades.[212] The contract for follow-on modernization work (after Block 4) is expected to be awarded in late 2018,[213][needs update] with a new block upgrade every two years thereafter as threats evolve.[214] These will alternate hardware and software upgrades, with each refreshed once every four years.[215] In 2016 Robert Weiss, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said that buying more F-35s now would make it cheaper to apply planned upgrades to the entire fleet later.[216]"}

The F-35 Lightning II was conceived from the start of the project as having participation from many countries, most of which would both contribute to the manufacture of the aircraft and procure it for their own armed forces. While the United States is the primary customer and financial backer, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada, Turkey, Australia, Norway and Denmark agreed to contribute US$4.375 billion toward the development costs of the program.[1] Total development costs are estimated at more than US$40 billion, while the purchase of an estimated 2,400 planes is expected to cost an additional US$200 billion.[2] Norway estimated that each of their planned 52 F-35 fighter jets will cost their country $769 million over their operational lifetime.[3] The nine major partner nations, including the U.S., plan to acquire over 3,100 F-35s through 2035,[4] which, if delivered will make the F-35 one of the most numerous jet fighters. There are three levels of international participation. The levels generally reflect the financial stake in the program, the amount of technology transfer and subcontracts open for bid by national companies, and the order in which countries can obtain production aircraft. The United Kingdom is the sole \"Level 1\" partner, contributing US$2.5 billion, which was about 10% of the planned development costs[5] under the 1995 Memorandum of Understanding that brought the UK into the project.[6] Level 2 partners are Italy, and the Netherlands, who are contributing US$1 billion and US$800 million each respectively. Level 3 partners are Turkey, US$195 million; Canada US$160 million; Australia, US$144 million; Norway, US$122 million and Denmark, US$110 million. Israel and Singapore have joined as so-called \"security cooperative participants\" (SCP).[7] Some initial partner countries, including the United Kingdom,[8] and Norway,[9] Netherlands[10] and Israel[11] have wavered in their public commitment to the JSF program, hinting that the design goals are overambitious or warning that unless they receive more subcontracts or technology transfer, they will forsake JSF for the Eurofighter Typhoon, Saab JAS 39 Gripen, Dassault Rafale or simply upgrade their existing aircraft. While the General Dynamics F-16E/F Fighting Falcon costs $50 million per export copy, the F-35 is likely to cost between $110–130 million.[12] The exported F-35 versions will have the same configuration as the U.S. versions, according to Brigadier General David Heinz, program executive officer in 2009.[13] In 2001, Lockheed Martin claimed a potential market of 5,179 aircraft, including exports beyond the partner countries. The size of the market was instrumental in determining many of the cost calculations and economies of scale. More recent critical analysis has seriously questioned the assumptions made in estimating these markets and hence the resulting unit cost of the aircraft and its life-cycle costs as well. Congress may allow the U.S. military to perform a \"block buy\" of 477 aircraft over 3 years, starting the cost/scale-spiral in a desirable direction.[14] Several government officials, including Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement, have used the production number of 5,000 as recently as September 2010 as an indication of the supposed benefit to industry in providing components and services for this large fleet. Analyst Kenneth Epps stated in November 2010: \"The global F-35 market of 'up to' 5,000 aircraft cited by Canadian industry and government officials is outdated and now greatly overstated. Realistically, the likelihood of worldwide F-35 sales is closer to the figure now given as the order total for the program partner countries, that is, 'up to' 3,500 aircraft. The uncritical use of F-35 sales projections that are now almost 10 years out of date calls into question other claims made by officials about the F-35 program.\"[15] An issue that affects all the international partners in the F-35 involves access to the computer software code for the aircraft. The F-35 relies heavily on software for operation of radar, weapons, flight controls and also maintenance. The U.S. military has stated that \"no country involved in the development of the jets will have access to the software codes\" and has indicated that all software upgrades will be done in the U.S. The U.S. government acknowledges that Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Turkey have all expressed dissatisfaction with that unilateral U.S. decision. The UK specifically indicated they might cancel its entire order of F-35s without access to the coding, without which the nation will be unable to maintain its own aircraft. Allen Sens, a defence analyst at the University of British Columbia stated in November 2009: \"What has happened is really quite unusual because we're talking about some of America's very close allies. You would have thought they could build in some maintenance codes that could be accessible to their allies.\" Sens indicated that the decision could be as a result of concerns about software security and also pressure from Congress to protect jobs in the U.S.[16] In December 2010, leaked United States diplomatic cables disclosed that the US State Department is actively engaged in marketing the F-35 internationally through diplomatic channels and that serious diplomatic pressure had been applied to Norway to buy the aircraft.[17] Jeff Abramson of the Arms Control Association has said that the push to sell the F-35 is part of Obama's \"national export initiative\" which seeks to double America's export sales through increased arms sales.[18] European participation in the Joint Strike Fighter project has divided the countries and helped preempt a European fifth generation jet fighter program, undercutting exports for their existing models.[19] In early 2012, after news leaked of a third restructuring of the program in three years, a parade of high-level visitors from the partner countries visited the United States to check on when they could get their aircraft.[8][9][10][20] Ahead of the usual biannual meeting of military leaders in Australia in mid-March, the partner nations agreed to hold annual meetings at the political level.[21] In March 2014, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin Canada, Mike Barton, said \"We've heard nothing about it impacting foreign interest,\" in reaction to General Mike Hostage, head of Air Combat Command, calling the aircraft irrelevant without accompanying F-22 Raptors.[22] As of April 2010, the United States intends to buy a total of 2,443 aircraft for an estimated US$323 billion, making the sale part of the most expensive defense program in U.S. history.[23] In September 2010, American purchase plans came under review over the rapidly escalating development and production costs of the aircraft. Initial estimates of US$50 million per aircraft had increased to at least US$92 million, with some U.S. estimates indicating US$135 million. The US Undersecretary of Defense, Ashton Carter, issued a memo in September 2010 requiring proposals on how to drive program costs down, stating \"The Department is scrubbing costs with the aim of identifying unneeded cost and rewarding its elimination over time.\" In response, Lockheed Martin has indicated that it is on \"the path to achieving an average unit cost of about $60 million\".[24] Also in September 2010, the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee indicated that the problems in the F-35 program were symptomatic of Pentagon mismanagement, pointing out \"the lack of proper control in the defense budget process\". The committee urged the Pentagon \"to regain control over its budget\". The committee also considered scrapping the entire program at that time, dissuaded only by the country's urgent need for new fighters.[25] New America Foundation defense analyst Bill Hartung has stated that the U.S. government may try to reduce the overall costs of the program purchasing fewer aircraft, but Hartung also notes that this will increase the per unit cost for international partners and reduce the amount of business given to companies bidding on manufacturing contracts in partner countries.[24] On 6 January 2011, United States Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates announced that the Defense Department would cut the number of planes the military will buy from Lockheed Martin in the next two years because of \"significant testing problems\" which could lead to a costly redesign of the F-35B that the program could not afford during federal budget cuts. \"If we cannot fix this variant [F-35B] during this time frame and get it back on track in terms of performance, cost and schedule, then I believe it should be canceled,\" Gates said in a statement.[26] The United States Department of Defense planned to buy 14 F-35Bs in fiscal year 2012 and 25 the following year. Instead, six will be bought next year and another six in fiscal year 2013. Over the next five years, the Marine Corps will receive 50 F-35s, down from a planned 110. The number of Navy F-35Cs and Air Force F-35As will also be reduced. The Navy total was reduced by seven jets over the next five years, with most of the cuts in fiscal year 2016, while the number of Air Force jets was decreased by 57 over the next five years. Only 19 jets are slated for delivery next year.[27] The plan as of early 2011 was that the Marine Corps would purchase 340 of the F-35B and 80 of the F-35C, while the Navy would purchase 260 of the F-35C. The five squadrons of Marine F-35Cs would be assigned to the Navy carrier air wings while the F-35Bs would be used on amphibious ships and ashore.[28][29][30] In March 2011, Vice Admiral David Venlet, the chief of the F-35 Joint Program Office, testified at a U.S. congressional committee that the F-35A procurement cost estimate will be $126.6 million per aircraft, including $15 million for the engine.[31] By the end of March 2011, the voices in the U.S. calling for the end to the F-35 program were increasing in volume. Dominic Tierney of The Atlantic pointed out the whole program cost is now forecast to exceed US$1T, more than the annual GDP of Australia. He noted, \"Money is pouring into the F-35 vortex.... An internal Pentagon report concluded that: \"affordability is no longer embraced as a core pillar\". In January 2011, even Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a champion of the aircraft, voiced his frustration: \"The culture of endless money that has taken hold must be replaced by a culture of restraint\".\" Tierney further noted that the F-35 is an old Cold War–concept aircraft intended for a war between major powers, and is no longer useful in the 21st century with its asymmetric warfare. He concluded: \"It's hard to square the military largesse with our rampant debt.\"[32] In April 2011, Winslow Wheeler, a former U.S. advisor to both Republican and Democratic senators, employee of the General Accounting Office and now with the Center for Defense Information in Washington, criticized the F-35's price and performance. \"This airplane is nothing to write home about,\" he stated, it is \"a gigantic performance disappointment\". Wheeler said: \"As an American, this program should be terminated immediately. It's unaffordable and the performance is unacceptable already. We need to start over and form a competitive fly-before-you-buy selection.\"[33] In April 2011, the USAF listed \"a more affordable JSF\" as its top acquisition priority.[34] On 20 May 2011, Senators on the Armed Services Committee asked Ashton Carter to report on alternatives should the F-35 program fail to delivery timely affordable capabilities, after Carter said that there were no good alternatives to the F-35.[35][36] Retiring Defense Secretary Bob Gates has said that troop pay, benefits, and numbers may need to be cut to pay for the F-35 cost overruns.[37] While the 2012 defense department Selected Acquisition Report shows the USAF purchase of 60 to 80 aircraft per year from 2016 to 2030, the USAF's goals for total numbers of fighter aircraft could be met by maintaining the 48 aircraft per year purchase rate of 2017. The increase in production rate would leave the USAF with 300 more aircraft than planned for in 2030.[38] On 29 November 2012, the Pentagon reached an agreement on Lot 5 of the F-35 program, buying 32 aircraft. Lot 5 contains 22 F-35As, 3 F-35Bs, and 7 F-35Cs. The contract deal was rushed to protect them from possible sequestration cuts.[39] However the JSF was noted as one of major programs that would suffer cuts if the house of representatives fails to follow the Senate's lead in passing a bill to resolve the United States fiscal cliff.[40][41] Lot 6 was awarded on 28 December 2012. The contract is for 18 F-35As, 6 F-35Bs, and 7 F-35Cs.[42] Deliveries of the Lot 6 order will begin in mid-2014. Lot 6 included the 31 aircraft for the U.S., plus 3 F-35As for Italy and 2 F-35As for Australia. As of 30 July 2013, Lockheed has delivered 67 F-35s from the first five production lots, with 28 still on order. On 30 July 2013, Lockheed agreed to reduce prices on Lot 6 by 4 percent compared to Lot 5, and will reduce the price of Lot 7 by another 4 percent. Pricing for Lot 5 took one year of negotiating, while Lots 6 and 7 took six months. Lot 6 prices are $100.8 million for the F-35A, $108.5 million for the F-35B, and $120 million for the F-35C. Lot 7 deliveries for 35 aircraft will begin in mid-2015, and includes 19 F-35As for the USAF, 6 F-35Bs for the USMC, 4 F-35Cs for the USN, 3 F-35As for Italy, 2 F-35As for Norway, and 1 F-35B for the U.K. Lot 7 prices are $96.8 million for the F-35A, $104.2 million for the F-35B, and $115.2 million for the F-35C. Full-rate production for the F-35A is expected at $80–90 million per unit.[43][44] A deal for Lots 6 and 7 was officially finalized on 24 September 2013.[45] By March 2014, due to budgetary constraints, the US Navy indicated that it would buy only 36 F-35Cs instead of 69 between 2015 and 2020. The USAF will also defer the purchase of four F-35As in 2015, while Marine Corps orders will not change. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel further indicated that the number of F-35s to be funded between 2014 and 2019 could be further reduced unless Congress revokes the automatic budget cuts programmed for FY2016 and later by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.[46] The deal for Lot 8 was finalised on 22 November 2014 at a cost of $4.7 Billion.[47] In April 2015, the US Navy indicated that it was looking at purchasing additional F-18 Super Hornets to fill in a gap in aircraft in service forecast as a result of increasing delays in the F-35 program.[48] In 2006, the United Kingdom was expected to acquire 138 F-35s,[49] down from the 2005 plan for 150 aircraft: 90 for the Royal Air Force; and 60 for the Royal Navy.[50] The UK became increasingly frustrated by a lack of U.S. commitment to grant access to the technology that would allow the UK to maintain and upgrade its F-35s without U.S. involvement. For five years, British officials sought an ITAR waiver to secure greater technology transfer. Although this had the support of the Bush administration, it was repeatedly blocked by U.S. Representative Henry Hyde, on the grounds that British laws were insufficient to prevent unauthorised transfer of U.S. technology to third parties.[51] On 27 May 2006, President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair announced that \"Both governments agree that the UK will have the ability to successfully operate, upgrade, employ, and maintain the Joint Strike Fighter such that the UK retains operational sovereignty over the aircraft.\"[52] In December 2006, an agreement was signed which met the UK's demands for further participation, i.e., access to software source code and operational sovereignty. The agreement allows \"an unbroken British chain of command\" for operation of the aircraft.[53] In 2007, the Ministry of Defence placed orders for two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers to operate the F-35B variant.[54] On 18 March 2009, Defence Secretary John Hutton announced the MoD had agreed to purchase three test F-35Bs,[55][56] and on 22 December 2009 financial approval for the purchase of the third aircraft was given.[57] On 26 January 2010, following over 18 months of simulator training, Squadron Leader Steve Long completed a test flight becoming the first British active duty pilot to fly the F-35.[58] Speculation mounted in 2009 that the UK government would switch from the F-35B to the F-35C model, with its greater range and payload. The UK would require fewer F-35Cs and save about $25 million for each aircraft ordered.[59] In October 2010, press reports suggested that the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government were considering reducing the order for the F-35 from 138 to an unspecified but lower number as of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. This was confirmed by a MoD spokeswoman in 2012.[60] The proposed cuts would also close RAF Lossiemouth, chosen as the main operating base for the F-35.[61] On 19 October 2010, Prime Minister David Cameron announced in the Strategic Defence and Security Review that the UK would procure an unspecified number of F-35Cs, to fly from a Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier, instead of the F-35B. This change would require the aircraft carrier to be equipped with catapults and arresting gear.[62] In January 2012, British Defence Minister Philip Hammond visited the United States to seek clarification about the impact of the new American military strategy on the availability of the F-35 for Britain's new carriers.[63] In May 2012, Hammond announced that the UK coalition government had reverted to the previous government's plan to operate the F-35B STOVL variant, due to rising estimated shipbuilding costs associated with the F-35C, and an earlier estimated in-service date for the F-35B.[64] In July 2012, Hammond stated that an initial 48 F-35Bs would be purchased to equip the carrier fleet, but a final figure of F-35 purchases would not be decided until the Strategic Defence and Security Review in 2015 – it was also suggested that the UK may later purchase F-35A variants to replace the country's Eurofighter Typhoon fleet.[65] In November 2015, the Chancellor George Osborne announced that the UK would order the full original total of 138 F-35 aircraft to equip the Royal Navy's two new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers.[citation needed] The aircraft would also be used by the Royal Air Force over time, and be one of the replacements for the Panavia Tornado. It was stated that at least 24 of the aircraft would be available by 2023 for use on board one of the navy's aircraft carriers, thus leaving more time for testing and training before it becomes operational. It was expected that all 138 F-35 aircraft will be in service by the 2030s. At least one permanent F-35 squadron would be stood up sometime around 2018, and expected to increase to two or three squadrons in the 2020s. The airplane is one of the two main fast jet aircraft operated by the Royal Air Force, the other being the Eurofighter Typhoon. Further acquisition of the F-35 by the Royal Air Force has been criticized due to its possible \"outdated\" capabilities by the 2030s (when the RAF would seek to begin replacing its Eurofighters) and lack of interoperability of the F-35B variant on the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers.[66] Instead, the Eurofighters may be replaced with the New Generation Fighter (NGF) or the BAE Systems Tempest.[67] A UK Defence Command paper released on 22 March 2021 removed the commitment to procuring 138 F-35s, stating instead that it will increase the fleet size beyond the 48 F-35Bs already ordered.[68] On 23 March, the First Sea Lord reportedly estimated that the final fleet will total between 60 and 80 aircraft.[69] The U.K.'s original \"Level 1\" status in the program was said to have expired in 2020.[70] In June 2025, the UK government announced plans to amend its F-35 order. As originally envisaged, a total of 138 aircraft, consisting entirely of the F-35B STOVL variant, were to be purchased, and were primarily intended to operate in the maritime strike role from the aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy. Delivery of the first tranche of 48 aircraft was due for completion in 2025, with another 27 to follow in the second tranche of airframes. But, in June of 2025, the UK indicated that it planned to restore to the RAF a nuclear role that it had not undertaken since the end of the Cold War, with aircraft capable of carrying the nuclear warheads. As a result, only 15 F-35Bs were to be procured as part of the second tranche, with the remaining 12 now to be F-35As. These would operate primarily as part of the RAF's operational conversion unit, freeing F-35Bs from this task, with the nuclear delivery role being additional to this.[71][72] Italy is the second largest JSF contributing partner after the UK. In October 2008, the Italian government outlined a requirement for 131 F-35s for the Aeronautica Militare and Marina Militare, consisting of 69 F-35As and 62 F-35Bs.[73][74] Under this plan, the Italian Navy would have received 22 F-35Bs while the Air Force would get 69 F-35A and 40 F-35B STOVL version aircraft. The Navy plans to use the F-35Bs on the new Cavour STOVL carrier.[75] Alenia Aermacchi will be the second source supplier of the wing box. Under the terms of agreement Alenia Aeronautica is slated to produce more than 1,200 wings for the F-35 for the nine partners, United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Turkey, Australia, Canada, Denmark and Norway.[76] Other participation in the program includes work on the electro-optical targeting system, on the electronic-warfare suite, ejection seat, radio, 25 mm gun and DAS systems, performed by Leonardo-Finmeccanica's companies. Avio participated in both the Pratt & Whitney F135 and General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 powerplant programs. On 7 October 2008, Italy announced it would not participate in initial F-35 testing and evaluation, and will not purchase test aircraft.[73] Italy's Air Base of Cameri will be the only Final Assembly and Check Out/Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul & Upgrade (FACO/MRO&U) facility outside the US,[77] for the final assembly of F-35s to be delivered to Italy and the Netherlands, with an estimated cost of $775 million. The FACO could also operate as a regional F-35 maintenance and support center. As of 2015[update], there are 800 Italians and 30-40 LM personnel at Cameri.[78] In early February 2012, Corriere della Sera reported that the Italian purchase would be cut back to 100 or at most 110 aircraft, but the defense ministry said at that time that no decision had been made.[79] On 15 February, Defence Minister Giampaolo Di Paola announced that Italy would cut its F-35 order by 41 aircraft from the initially announced 131 to 90 as a result of the country's sovereign debt crisis.[80][81] On 26 June 2013, Italy's ruling parties agreed to again seek parliament approval before advancing further in the program.[82] Parliament approved a six-month review of the program by a vote of 381 to 149.[83] On 16 July 2013, the senate agreed to allow the existing purchase to go through, but said they would review any further purchase.[84] The first F-35A assembled in Italy flew from Cameri on 7 September 2015.[78] In July 2018, after the rise of the Conte Cabinet, it was reported that no more Italian orders for F-35 are expected, and the current order could be cut to save money.[85] In October that year, the Italian government announced it would cut €450 million from its 2019 defense budget. One of the measures taken to achieve this is a slowdown in the purchase of F-35 aircraft to spread out payment.[86] In November 2018, it was reported that the slowdown would reduce Italy's acquisition rate from ten aircraft per year down to six or seven, but still ultimately buying 90 aircraft total.[87] In December 2018, the Italian Defence Ministry reiterated that the government would not reduce the order, and that Italy stands by its decision to procure the F-35, despite conflicting statements by coalition party members in the past.[88] The Netherlands had plans to acquire 85 F-35As for the Royal Netherlands Air Force.[89] The aircraft will replace an aging fleet of F-16AMs. The Dutch government had expected that the costs would be €5.5 billion for the initial purchase and €9.1 billion for 30 years of service, which comes down to a lifetime cost of about US$215 million per unit.[N 1][90][N 2] On 19 November 2007, in the Dutch Parliament, the Secretary of Defence was questioned about the JSF delay, technical problems and rising costs.[91] However, on 29 February 2008, the executive council of the Dutch government decided to go ahead with the purchase of two test aircraft, and a memorandum of understanding was signed.[92] On 7 September 2008 Dutch television show \"Reporter\" reports that counter orders are lagging behind compared to promises and that an active lobby by the Royal Netherlands Air Force has manipulated the Dutch government into participating in the project.[93] In 2010, the Dutch parliament voted to cancel its order for the first test series.[94] Because there was only a caretaker government at that time, Defence Minister Van Middelkoop stated he can and will not honor the wishes of the parliament, but that the next government should decide on the issue.[95] The next defence Minister Hans Hillen planned to continue the purchase in the face of budget cuts that will see thousands of defense employees go as well as the sell off of Dutch military aircraft and ships, in order to maintain Dutch industrial participation in the F-35 program.[96] On 20 April 2011 the newly elected Dutch parliament reversed the vote by its predecessor and voted to purchase a second test F-35.[97] In December 2010, Defence Minister Hans Hillen said that he had \"great difficulty\" with a cost increase of 20% over what the Netherlands had budgeted and that he would work with the UK and Norway on the issue.[98][99] On 8 April 2011, the Netherlands agreed to buy a second test aircraft,[100] and signed a deal to purchase it at the end of the month.[101] Later that month, Dutch defence minister Hans Hillen suggested that their purchase level would be lower than 85, as the plan was to replace F-16s on a one for one basis and Dutch F-16 numbers had already dropped to 68.[102] Lockheed was confident that the Netherlands will purchase the full order of 85 F-35 fighters.[103] However, the Dutch Minister of Defence announced in March 2013 that the test program would be stopped until further notice and that the purchase of the F-35 was not at all certain. The two F-35s on order will be placed in storage until a decision is made.[104] Considerations of some Dutch politicians to buy alternatives such as Saab AB's Gripen, Boeing F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet or the EADS Eurofighter, caused the US DoD to suggest (in April 2013) these options would cost more in the long run.[105] In 2013 the Netherlands Court of Audit found that increasing per-unit costs of the F-35 had driven the number of aircraft that could be afforded below the minimum level needed to fulfill NATO requirements.[106] In September the Dutch government stated a commitment to replace the F-16 with F-35. The anticipated number is 37, and the budget is 4.5 billion euros ($6.01 billion) for the warplanes and an additional 270 million euros per year in operating costs.[105] On 17 September 2013 the Dutch government announced that it will purchase 37 JSF fighters for a purchase price of around 4.5 billion euro.[107] In January 2014, the Dutch defence and foreign affairs ministers revealed that their F-35s could be used for delivery of nuclear weapons. The previous year Parliament support no nuclear role for the F-35 and the ministers still support disarmament, but they say the Netherlands still has a nuclear role \"for the time being\" due to their role within NATO.[108] In September 2018, the Ministry of Defence removed the cap of €4.5 billion allocated to the procurement of the F-35, a political decision that was reached in 2013 as it was a demand from the coalition partner Labour Party. The potentially enlarged budget would allow the Royal Netherlands Air Force to procure the initially planned 67 aircraft spread over 4 squadrons.[109] In December 2018, Dutch Minister of Defence Ank Bijleveld stated that the Netherlands is investing in its armed forces to grow towards and eventually reach the NATO 2% of GDP defense spending norm. In this statement, minister Bijleveld also stated that NATO desires a third Dutch F-35 squadron, which equals to 15 aircraft in addition to the current order of 37.[110] On 30 May 2022, as part of bringing the Dutch defense budget to 2% of GDP NATO standards, the Ministry of Defense decided on an additional purchase of 6 F-35s resulting in a total order of 52.[111] Australia is participating in the F-35's development (also known as AIR600 Phase 2A/2B), and expects that overall, 72 or more F-35As will be ordered[112] to replace the Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF's) F/A-18 Hornet aircraft.[113][114] The government of Australia announced that it would buy into the F-35's development on 22 June 2002.[113] This decision ended the competition to replace Australia's F/A-18 and F-111 aircraft before it formally began, with other aircraft manufacturers being advised that it would not be worth submitting proposals.[115] The program is intended to replace the Air Force's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fleet.[116] The government argued that joining the F-35 program at an early stage would allow Australia to influence the F-35's development, provide the government with information on the aircraft's suitability, and generate savings of over $600 million if an order for F-35s is eventually placed. Australia formally signed up to the F-35 \"systems development and demonstration phase\" as a Level 3 participant on 30 October 2002.[113] In 2002, the Howard government ignored military advice that it was too soon to join the F-35 program,[117] and directed the \"Air 6000\" program to settle on the JSF. The expected cost was $28 million per fighter in 1994 US dollars.[118][119] In November 2006, declaring satisfaction with the F-35's progress to date, the government gave 'first-pass' initial approval to the project under which F-35s will be acquired, deferring to late 2008 a decision on whether to actually order the aircraft. Following this initial approval, on 13 December 2006 Australia signed the JSF Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding, which commits Australia to the next phase of the F-35's development.[120] In October 2006 the deputy chief of the Air Force, Air Vice Marshal John Blackburn, publicly stated that the RAAF had considered suitable aircraft which could be acquired if the F-35 was delayed, but that such aircraft were not believed to be necessary on the basis of the F-35 program's progress at the time.[121] Concerns over the F-35 delivery schedule developed in Australia during 2007.[120] In February the defence minister announced that a risk mitigation strategy, which involved obtaining F/A-18F Hornets, was being developed to prevent a gap in the RAAF's air combat capability if the F-35 program was delayed.[122] This strategy was adopted, and an order for 24 F/A-18Fs was announced on 6 March 2007. The first aircraft was delivered in 2009[123] and the first squadron was declared operational in December 2010.[124] Following the 2007 Australian Federal Election, the new Australian Labor Party Government launched an inquiry into the replacement of the RAAF's air combat capability.[125] The party had expressed concerns over the F-35's adequacy while it was in opposition, and proposed acquiring F-22s to replace or supplement the RAAF's F-35 force.[126][127] An approach was made to the U.S. Government for F-22s in early 2008, but was not successful as these aircraft are not available for export.[128] In April 2008 it was reported that the air combat review had found that the F-35 was the most suitable aircraft for Australia.[129] In 2011 leaked documents revealed that the review and the attempt to purchase the F-22 were simply to satisfy domestic politics in Australia and no serious consideration had been given to any aircraft other than the F-35.[130] In October 2008 it was reported that the Australian Government may order 75 F-35s instead of the 100 originally planned, due to the impact of the 2008 financial crisis and a large long-term funding gap in the Defence budget.[114] The Government's Defence white paper released in April 2009 argued for a purchase of up to 100 F-35s, however.[131] There has been much debate in Australia over whether the F-35 is the most suitable aircraft for the RAAF. It has been claimed that the F-35's performance is inferior to Russian-built fighters operated by countries near Australia (such as the Su-27 and Su-30 in Indonesia), that it cannot meet the RAAF's long-range strike requirement, and that further delays to the F-35 program may result in the RAAF experiencing a shortage of combat aircraft.[132] The RAAF has stated that it believes that the F-35 will meet Australia's needs,[133] and both of Australia's major political parties currently support the development and purchase of the aircraft (though differences remain on the deadline and the number of aircraft).[134][135] Former defence minister Joel Fitzgibbon has charged the defence chiefs with an obsession for the JSF.[136] On 21 August 2009, it was reported that the RAAF would get two F-35s for testing in 2014 and that the initial squadron would be delayed until 2017.[137] On 11 September 2009, Air Marshall Mark Binskin said that a fourth squadron of F-35s for the RAAF would be imperative.[138] On 25 November 2009, Australia committed to placing a first order for 14 aircraft at a cost of A$3.2 billion, with deliveries to begin in 2014.[112] However, in May 2012, it was announced that the purchase of twelve F-35As from the initial order were being deferred to 2014 as part of wider ADF budget cuts in order to balance the Federal Government budget for the 2012-13 financial year.[139][140] Air Marshal Geoff Brown, the Chief of Air Force, has said that \"anything less than 100 JSFs severely limits the options available to government and only provides a boutique capability\", and that the fighter is necessary for the RAAF to be able to keep up with the aircraft other air forces in Australia's region are expected to operate in the 2020s.[141] The construction of the Canberra-class amphibious vessels for the Royal Australian Navy has led to suggestions from some quarters that the RAN should procure a number of the F-35B STOVL version to operate from these ships.[142] However, while cross-decking with other nations may well occur, the RAN has stated that the operation of Australian fixed wing aircraft is unlikely.[143] In 2014 Defence Minister David Johnston said that the government was considering the purchase of F-35Bs to use aboard the ships.[144] Tony Abbott directed that the team developing a new defence white paper consider the issue.[145] This assessment found that the cost of modifying the ships to operate F-35Bs would be very high, and the idea was rejected before the completion of the White Paper.[146] On 23 April 2014, Australia confirmed the purchase of 58 F-35A Lightning II fighters in a US$11.5 billion deal. The 58 fighter order is the second tranche of the Australian Defence Force's Air 6000 Phase 2A/2B new air combat capability (NACC) project, with a previous order of 14 F-35s being the first tranche.[147] The 72 F-35s replaced the RAAF's fleet of 71 F/A-18A/B Hornets and supplemented the country's F/A-18F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler fleets. The first four F-35s were delivered to Australia in 2018, with initial operating capability being reached in 2020. A Phase 2C tranche of the plan is to purchase 28 more planes to replace the Air Force's 24 Super Hornets. Although Super Hornets were bought as a bridging capability until the arrival of the F-35, delays in the JSF program will keep the Super Hornets and Growlers flying for 20 years, with a decision regarding Phase 2C deferred until the early 2020s.[148][149] The purchase will be in line with previous defense budget planning.[150] Australia's first F-35A, designated AU-1 by Lockheed and A35-001 by the RAAF, made its first flight on 29 September 2014 at the company's Fort Worth, Texas facility, flying for two hours.[151] AU-1 and AU-2 will be transferred to the USAF training school at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona in early 2015. RAAF F-35s will remain at Luke AFB until 2018, when they will be delivered to Australia for national-specific operational test and evaluation work.[152] Australia started an A$950 million program in 2015 to provide better security for its F-35 bases.[153] At the end of 2020, The RAAF had reported that 60 out of the 72 aircraft ordered had been delivered, with the final 12 to be delivered by the end of 2023.[154] In February 2024, 63 F-35A are already delivered to RAAF, and the last 9 are to be delivered in the second half of the year.[155] Currently, the Royal Australian Air Force maintains three combat squadrons of the F-35A throughout Australia, one at RAAF Base Tindal, plus two and a training unit at RAAF Base Williamtown.[154] Timeline: Canada has been involved in the Joint Strike Fighter Program from its beginning, investing US$10 million to be an \"informed partner\" during the evaluation process. Once Lockheed Martin was selected as the primary contractor for the JSF program, Canada elected to become a level 3 participant, along with Norway, Denmark, Turkey and Australia. An additional US$100 million from the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND) over 10 years and another $50 million from Industry Canada were dedicated in 2002, making them an early participant of the JSF program.[157] On 16 July 2010, the Canadian government announced that it would buy 65 F-35s to replace the existing 80 CF-18s for $16B (with all ancillary costs included) with deliveries planned for 2016. The intention to sign a sole-sourced, untendered F-35 contract and the government's refusal to provide detailed costing became one of the major causes of a finding of contempt of Parliament and the subsequent defeat of Stephen Harper's Conservative government through a non-confidence vote on 25 March 2011. This directly led to the F-35 purchase becoming an issue in the 2011 federal election, in which Harper's Conservatives won an increased number of seats to form a majority government.[158][159][160][161][162] On 19 October 2015, the Liberal Party of Canada under Justin Trudeau won a large majority in part on a campaign promise to not purchase the F-35, but instead an aircraft more suited to Canada's defence requirements.[163][164] However, the new Defence Minister has refused to rule out the F-35 in a new procurement competition.[165] On 28 March 2022, the Government of Canada announced that the competition had placed the F-35A first and planned to buy 88 of them. Under procurement rules, the government will now enter into negotiations with Lockheed Martin for the purchase and if an acceptable agreement is not reached then negotiations for the second place Saab Gripen will begin.[166][167][168] In December 2022, the government placed an order for an initial batch of 16 F-35As, securing delivery positions prior to the year end.[169] On 9 January 2023, the Government of Canada announced the purchase of 88 F-35As, at a total cost of $19 billion Canadian Dollars. First aircraft are to arrive in 2026, first squadron will be operational in 2029 and full fleet operational between 2032 and 2034.[170][171][172] Denmark has joined the Joint Strike Fighter program as a Level 3 partner in 2002. The Royal Danish Air Force is replacing its fleet of 48 aging F-16 fighters with F-35As.[173] Denmark's members of parliament were not expected to vote on a purchase of the F-35A before 2014, and were considering alternatives such as the JAS 39 Gripen NG and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, while the consortium behind the Eurofighter Typhoon withdrew in 2007.[174][175][176] As of 2010, a Royal Danish Air Force F-16BM (ET 210) is stationed at Edwards Air Force Base for flight testing of the F-35. The Danish test pilot Lieutenant Colonel Casper Børge Nielsen is part of the Joint Strike Fighter program.[177] On 13 March 2013, Denmark restarted their selection process for 30 new fighter aircraft. Candidates include the two-seated F/A-18F Super Hornet,[178] and Eurofighter Typhoon, with the F-35A remaining as a candidate.[179] On 9 June 2016, the Danish defence committee agreed to purchase 27 F-35As to succeed the F-16 for US$3 billion.[180][181] In September 2016, Boeing, the builder of the F/A18E/F Super Hornet, indicated that they would take legal action against the Danish decision to buy the F-35A, indicating that data used was flawed.[182] In March 2018, Boeing lost the case with the court stating \"The court has found that the authorities' decisions on refusal of access to the documents are legal and valid.\"[183] In October 2025, the Danish government decided to purchase an additional 16 aircraft. In total, the Danish Air Force will have 43 F-35As.[184] In May 2019, Danish Minister of Defence Claus Hjort Frederiksen stated that Denmark is considering stationing fighter jets in Greenland to counter Russia's expanding military presence in the Arctic region. In an additional interview with Ritzau, the minister said that to provide air defense of Greenland would require at least four fighter planes, which would require Denmark to make an additional purchase.[185][186] In January 2020, Lockheed Martin announced that assembly had begun on L-001, the first of 27 F-35As destined for the Royal Danish Air Force.[187] Norway participates in the F-35 program as a Level 3 partner in the system development and demonstration phase, with a view to enabling its industry to compete for industrial opportunities.[188] Norwegian National Deputy Rune Fagerli, the country's sole representative on the Joint Strike Fighter program, told SPACE.com that the Norwegian Royal Ministry of Defence has pledged $125 million in preparation to replace a fleet of F-16 jets that have about 12 years left of operation. \"By getting involved here on the ground level, we can try and address the needs of Norway into this capable fighter early,\" said Fagerli, a colonel. For example, Norwegian F-16s are fitted with drag chutes because of wet, slippery runways. Likewise, international cooperation in aircraft development could also yield aircraft from cooperating nations that fit well together during combat. Fagerli also mentioned that Norwegian pilots currently fly missions over Afghanistan in F-16s alongside Danish and Dutch aviators.[189] Norway has several times threatened to put their support on hold unless substantial guarantees for an increased industrial share is provided. Despite this Norway has signed all the Memoranda of Understanding, including the latest one detailing the future production phase of the JSF program. They have, however, indicated that they will increase and strengthen their cooperation with both competitors of the JSF, the Typhoon and the Gripen.[190] Norway has delayed a decision on the purchase of four training F-35s until later in 2011.[191] The F-35 was evaluated along with JAS 39 Gripen by the Norwegian Future Combat Aircraft Capability Project as a replacement for the F-16s.[192] On 20 November 2008, the government released a statement saying it will support buying F-35s for the Royal Norwegian Air Force instead of the Gripen NG.[193] The government's reasoning for choosing the F-35 over Gripen was that only the U.S. aircraft supposedly fulfilled the operational requirements, and that it was allegedly offered at a more competitive price than the Swedish fighter.[194] This has been strongly criticized by Saab, saying that Norway made errors when calculating the cost for Gripen NG vs the cost for the JSF.[195][196] The Norwegian Air Force has decided to develop the Joint Strike Missile for the F-35 and other aircraft.[197] In December 2010, leaked United States diplomatic cables revealed that the U.S. decided to delay a request by Sweden for an AESA radar for the Gripen until after Norway had announced their decision to buy the F-35. The same cables indicated that Norwegian consideration of the Gripen \"was just a show\" and that Norway had decided to purchase the F-35 as a result of \"high-level political pressure\" from the US. Following the successful sale of the F-35 to Norway, U.S. officials compiled a \"lessons learned\" memo that included a list of tactics for future sales to other countries. These included using the active involvement of the local U.S. embassy and its ambassador to market the aircraft, coordinating sales strategies with Lockheed Martin and using diplomatic events to specifically talk about the F-35. These events could include ambassadorial luncheons with national people of influence as invited guests. The documents indicate that U.S. officials were attempting to make the sale \"without appearing to bully or attempt to force a decision\".[17][198] In June 2011, the Socialist Left party called for a probe into the rising costs of the jets.[199] Like Canada, Norway also needs to use satellite communications for operations north of the Arctic Circle, a capability not to be delivered with the first batch of aircraft.[200] On 24 November 2011, Norwegian officials estimated the life cycle costs for 52 F-35A to be $40 billion, in a hearing in the House of Commons of Canada.[3] On 14 June 2012, Norway placed an order for its first two aircraft,[201] after receiving a promise of American support to integrate the Joint Strike Missile on the F-35.[202] The number of aircraft ordered grew to 16 by October 2013.[203] On 22 September 2015, the first Norwegian F-35A was rolled out in Fort Worth, Texas. The first two examples for Norway are scheduled to be delivered to the Royal Norwegian Air Force later in 2015, and will be based at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, where they will be used for Norwegian and partner country pilot training.[204] Norway received its first three F-35s in-country in November 2017,[205] reached initial operating capability in November 2019,[206] and scrambled its F-35s for the first time in response to two Russian Tupolev Tu-142 and a Mikoyan MiG-31 passing near Norwegian airspace in March 2020.[207] On 12 July 2002, Turkey became the seventh international partner in the JSF Project, joining the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada, Denmark and Norway. On 25 January 2007, Turkey signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for involvement in F-35 production.[208] The Turkish Air Force is planning to initially order 116[209][210] F-35A \"CTOL/Air Force versions\" at a reported cost of $11 billion.[211] In October 2009, Murad Bayar, head of the Undersecretariat for Defense Industries, has said that Turkey may increase its order to 120 aircraft instead of purchasing Eurofighter Typhoons.[212] The plan is that the F-35 will be produced under license in Turkey by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI). TAI is one of the two international suppliers to Northrop Grumman (the other being Terma in Denmark).[213] A Letter of Intent (LOI) was signed between TAI and Northrop Grumman ISS (NGISS) International on 6 February 2007. With the LOI, TAI became the second source for the F-35 center fuselage. The number of center fuselages to be produced by TAI will depend on the number of F-35s Turkey procures and the number of F-35s produced worldwide. On 10 December 2007, TAI was authorized by Northrop Grumman to commence fabricating access doors and composite parts for the first two F-35 production aircraft. These components are used in the F-35 center fuselage, a major section of the aircraft being produced by Northrop Grumman, a principal member of the Lockheed Martin-led F-35 global industry team.[214] Northrop Grumman currently produces all F-35 center fuselages at its F-35 assembly facility in Palmdale, California. After 2013, TAI will assemble the F-35 under license from Lockheed Martin Corporation, as was the case with the F-16 program.[citation needed] By January 2011 there were indications that Turkey was reconsidering its participation in the F-35 program and its procurement of the aircraft. Political friction between Turkey and the US resulted in the US refusing to ship or delaying shipments of F-16 parts to Turkey over relations with Israel and Turkish officials are concerned that similar problems will make F-35 production and support of the 100 F-35s it has planned to buy non-viable. Rising costs in the F-35 program are also a factor and Turkey is considering developing its own fighter instead in cooperation with other nations.[215] However Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul, has said that Turkey may buy as many as 116 of the Joint Strike Fighter.[216] Turkey, like other partner nations, has complained about the United States refusal to share the software source code for the F-35.[217][218] On 24 March 2011 Turkey announced it is placing its order for 100 jets on hold due to the ongoing source code refusal issue. Defense Minister Vecdi Gönül said that the negotiations for access to the F-35 source codes, including codes that can be used to control the aircraft remotely, had not yielded \"satisfactory results\" and that under these conditions Turkey could not accept the aircraft.[219] In April 2012, Turkey suggested that program costs could be reduced by outsourcing more production to Turkish defense and aerospace companies, which operate with lower labour costs compared to their counterparts in the U.S. and other partner countries of the project.[220] Despite the software dispute, Turkey agreed in principle to order two F-35As in January 2012.[221][222] However, this decision was postponed during the SSIK meeting in January 2013 due to the technical problems with the aircraft and the uncertainties over the rising costs.[223] Turkey's first F-35s are now due to be delivered in 2017, as opposed to 2015.[224] On 6 May 2014, Turkey approved an initial order for two F-35s after a 15-month delay. They will be manufactured in the Block 3F configuration. Turkey is to take delivery of 10 aircraft per year after they enter service in 2018, with 100 F-35s total on order. The country has invested $195 million in the program since 1999 and total program cost is expected to reach $16 billion.[225] In January 2015 Turkey ordered a further four F-35s, for a total of six.[226] On 30 June 2018, Turkey received its first F-35 at Lockheed Martin facilities in Fort Worth, Texas. The first aircraft, with tail number 18-0001, was to be assigned to Luke Air Force Base for pilot training.[227] On 29 August 2018, a Turkish pilot carried out the first flight with an F-35 as part of training in the U.S.[228] In total, six aircraft, given code numbers 18-0001 to 18-0006,[229] were delivered to Luke AFB, where Turkish pilots received training until 2019.[230][231][232] On 18 June 2018, the U.S. Senate passed a bill blocking the transfer of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey. The prohibition was established due to concerns over Turkey's intent to procure the Russian S-400 air defence system, which would allegedly put the secrets of the F-35 at risk.[233][234] In August 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the bill, which blocked the transfer of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey.[235] Despite the suspension of deliveries, the F-35 Joint Program Office claimed on 21 August, that it would execute the program according to existing plans.[236] Another bill was passed by the US Senate on 23 August, which prohibited any spending related to the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until it was certified that Turkey would not purchase nor accept delivery of the Russian S-400 air defence system.[237] In early April 2019, it was reported that delivery of F-35 jets to Turkey was suspended due to Turkey's decision to continue procuring the S-400 air defence system.[238][239] On 10 April 2019, Turkish Foreign Minister reiterated that the S-400 purchase was going on as planned and suggested that Turkey could also look towards acquiring Russian jets, namely the Su-34 and Su-57, if the F-35 deal were to fall through.[240] In early May 2019, it was reported that the Pentagon was looking to move manufacturing of parts and equipment of the F-35 out of Turkey.[241] On 18 May 2019, the Turkish President announced that Turkey would jointly produce the S-500 missile system with Russia.[242] In June 2019, it was reported that the United States had decided to stop training additional Turkish pilots on the F-35.[243] Soon after, it was reported that training of all Turkish pilots was halted.[244] On 17 July 2019, following the delivery of Russian S-400 air defence systems, the United States announced that Turkey would be removed from the F-35 program. Besides the ban on training of pilots and delivery of the aircraft, the move would also include removing Turkey from the supply chain.[245][246] Although Turkey has since been formally removed from the program, U.S. Defense officials stated in June 2020 that Turkey would still manufacture key fuselage and engine parts through 2022, as existing manufacturing contracts will still be honored to completion, and to prevent \"costly, disruptive and wasteful contract terminations\".[247] The six delivered F-35s remain in storage at Luke Air Force Base. The United States has yet to settle compensation surrounding the $1.4 billion that Turkey paid for the program.[231] In 2024, the US announced that if Turkey were to give up its S-400 systems, it would be permitted back into the F-35 program. In 2003, Israel signed a formal letter of agreement, worth almost $20 million, to join the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) effort for the F-35 as a \"security cooperation participant\" (SCP).[248] The Israeli Air Force (IAF) stated in 2006 that the F-35 is a key part of IAF's recapitalization plans, and that Israel intended to buy over 100 F-35A fighters at an estimated cost of over $5 billion to replace their F-16s over time.[249] Israel was reinstated as a partner in the development of the F-35 on 31 July 2006, after Israeli participation was put on hold following the Chinese arms deal crisis.[250] Israel will buy 20 initial examples of the F-35A, with a total of 75 fighters desired.[251] In February 2003, Singapore joined the JSF program's System Design and Development (SDD) Phase, as a Security Co-operation Participant (SCP).[252] It was speculated that Singapore could be buying up to 100 F-35s.[253] In late 2013, Singapore said they were in \"no particular hurry\" to buy the F-35, and that they were focusing on upgrading their F-16s in the near-term. It was speculated that Singapore has specific interest in acquiring the F-35B STOVL variant due to the use of road bases adjacent to airfields, most shorter than 8,000 ft (2,400 m).[254] It was speculated that the F-35B could also prove useful if the Endurance-class ships were converted to landing helicopter docks.[255] In August 2016, the speculation ended with Singapore announcing it has placed on hold any decision to buy up to 12 F-35.[256] In January 2019, Singapore's Minister for Defense Ng Eng Hen announced that Singapore's F-16C/Ds would retire \"soon after 2030\", and that he was happy to report that the Defence Science and Technology Agency and Republic of Singapore Air Force completed their evaluation and decided on the F-35 to be the most likely aircraft to replace it. The Ministry of Defense announced in a statement that the Republic of Singapore Air Force would first procure an unspecified \"small number\" of F-35s for full evaluation of their capabilities and sustainability before deciding on a full fleet.[257][258][259] In March 2019, Singapore's Minister of Defence Ng Eng Hen announced Singapore would procure 4 F-35 aircraft for further evaluation, with an option to procure an additional 8 under the same contract. Ng Eng Hen added that a letter of request would be submitted to the United States in the near future, but did not clarify which variant of the F-35 was to be requested.[260][261][262] In January 2020, the US government approved the procurement of four F-35B jets with the option to buy eight more of the same aircraft, as well as up to 13 engines, electronic warfare systems and related support and logistics services for US$2.75 billion by Singapore.[263] On 28 February 2024, Minister Ng announced in parliament the procurement of 8 F-35As expected to be delivered by 2030, tallying up a total of 20 F-35s on delivery.[264] The first delivery of F-35s is scheduled for the end of 2026.[265] In 2009, Belgium suggested that they might buy some F-35s in the 2020s.[266] An article published in Belgian newspaper L'Avenir on 19 April 2015 speculated that if the nuclear strike role as part of Belgium's Nuclear sharing policy were retained in the request for proposals, Belgium would be almost forced to buy the F-35 in order to maintain this role.[267][268] Belgium officially launched its F-16 replacement program in March 2017, issuing requests for proposals to three European and two US manufacturers: Boeing Defense, Space & Security, Lockheed Martin, Dassault Aviation, Eurofighter GmbH and Saab Group, offering the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-35 Lightning II, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab JAS 39 Gripen respectively.[269][270] In April 2017, Boeing announced it would not compete with its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in the competition, citing it \"does not see an opportunity to compete on a truly level playing field\", hinting that the program may be biased.[271][272] In July 2017, Saab, too, announced it decided not to respond to the request citing Swedish foreign policy and political mandate reasons.[273] In October 2017, just after the deadline closed, France's Dassault Aviation responded with a much deeper offer, not only offering 34 Dassault Rafale aircraft, but also invoking broad cooperation in the fields of service, training and operations. The French Ministry of the Armed Forces stated that the offer would also strengthen European defence.[274][275] The Belgian Ministry of Defence responded by stating that the offer was not submitted correctly and that only two conforming bids were received, for the Eurofighter Typhoon and Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. The Ministry also stated it was seeking legal advice to further investigate the offer, but noted that none of the questions stated in the request for proposals was answered by the French offer.[276][277] In January 2018, the United States Department of State approved the potential Foreign Military Sale of 34 F-35As to Belgium for an estimated cost of US$6.53 billion.[278][279][280][281] In March 2018, leaked documents from the Belgian Ministry of Defence supposedly indicated that the Belgian Air Component leadership had long been making preparations to procure the F-35, after a promise was made to NATO about its procurement in 2013, without informing Belgium's political leaders. According to some, the procurement procedure was modified to give the F-35 an advantage and it was expected to win the competition by a wide margin.[282][283] In April 2018 the leaked documents were discussed in a much publicized parliamentary hearing during which it became clear that at least some of the documents had been taken out of context.[284] In May 2019, new documents surfaced that added to the theory that the competition was biased. These documents soon turned out to be fabricated.[285] In June 2018, despite earlier claims by a spokesperson of the Minister of Defence that the F-16 replacement program was going ahead as planned,[286] the Belgian government decided to delay the decision until October and began reconsidering the option of purchasing Dassault Rafale fighters, as well as upgrading their existing fleet of aircraft.[287][288] On 25 October 2018, Belgium officially selected the offer for 34 F-35As to replace the current fleet of around 54 F-16s. In the accompanied news conference, government officials stated that the decision to select the F-35 over the Eurofighter Typhoon came down to the price, and later stated that \"The offer from the Americans was the best in all seven evaluation criteria\". The total purchasing price for the aircraft and its support until 2030 totaled €4 billion, €600 million cheaper than the initially budgeted €4.6 billion. First deliveries are scheduled to take place in 2023.[289][290] In March 2019, Belgium's independent parliamentary watchdog concluded that the competition had been conducted in a fair and transparent way.[291] A December 2019 audit from the same parliamentary watchdog concluded that the F-16 was becoming increasingly hard and costly to maintain, casting serious doubt over the once proposed option to extend their service lives.[292] In April 2020, the first official contract for the procurement of the F-35 was signed, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2023.[293] In June 2025, the Belgian government De Wever decided that Belgium will purchase additional F-35As. They talked of 21 additional aircraft. Due to budgetary challenges, the final number of additional F-35s will be reduced to 11 aircraft. That brings the total fleet to 45 F-35As.[294] The Finnish Air Force has expressed its interest in the F-35, and other \"advanced aircraft\", as the replacement for its F-18C Hornets. Major General Lauri Puranen said in June 2015, \"These five fighters are Eurofighter, French Dassault Rafale, American Boeing Super Hornet or Lockheed Martin JSF F-35, and Swedish JAS 39 Gripen. All of these are possible and we don't have a favorite.\" The selection process began in 2018 with a decision by 2020 or 2021.[295][296] On 27 April 2018, the Finnish Defence Forces issued a Request for Quotation for the HX Fighter Program. The request asked quotations on the Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35 and Saab Gripen. The final quotations are to be requested in 2020 and a decision would be made in 2021. Their existing fleet of Hornets would begin to be phased out in 2025. The program also includes an obligation for at least 30 percent domestic industrial participation.[297] On 6 December 2021 multiple reports emerged that the Finnish Defense Forces have selected the F-35A as the winner of its HX Fighter program, to replace its legacy fleet of F/A-18 Hornets. The same sources have reported that the odds of the Finnish Government rejecting the decision are \"quite slim\". In 2020 the U.S. State Department granted Finland full approval to order the F-35 if it were to be selected.[298] On 10 December 2021 F-35A was selected as the winner of the HX programme.[299] The order is for 64 F-35's, valued at around 8.4 billion EUR, with deliveries beginning in 2026.[300][301] German officials first met with Lockheed Martin officials in June 2017, during the Paris Air Show after having issued a request for a confidential meeting to discuss the F-35 as a potential Panavia Tornado replacement a month before.[302][303] After it became clear that the F-35 was a serious candidate by September 2017, the German Federal Ministry of Defence sent a letter to Boeing, requesting a similar classified meeting on the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, as well as Airbus for additional information on the Eurofighter Typhoon, an aircraft the German Air Force already operates.[304][305] In November 2017, the German Air Force had come up with a shortlist for the types of aircraft most fit to replace its Panavia Tornado fleet. The F-35 was considered the preferred choice as it fulfilled most of the requirements and offered a number of additional benefits beside.[306][307] Soon after, however, mixed signals started arriving from the German Air Force, Federal Ministry of Defence and the Parliament, with some officials distancing themselves from the choices made in shortlisting the F-35, and touting the Eurofighter Typhoon as the preferred alternative.[308][309][310] In March 2018, Lieutenant general of the German Air Force Karl Müllner was dismissed from service after stating his preference for the F-35. Although the official reason was a reorganization in the German Air Force's structure, it is widely speculated that the dismissal is part of an effort to steer the German Air Force away from the F-35.[311][312][313] It was speculated that Germany's choice was limited to the F-35 because of its need to fulfill a credible nuclear strike capability as per the NATO nuclear sharing agreement. The Eurofighter Typhoon is not currently able to fulfill this role, and its ability to penetrate potentially hostile Russian airspace in the event of a nuclear escalation is considered weaker than that of the F-35.[314] However, in January 2019 the F-35 was eliminated from the competition,[315] leaving only the Typhoon and the Super Hornet as candidates. In March 2020, German newspaper Handelsblatt reported that the German Federal Ministry of Defence was preparing to procure a mixture of 90 new Typhoons and 45 Super Hornets.[316] The Super Hornets are to be tasked with performing nuclear strike roles under the NATO nuclear sharing agreement.[317] As of March 2020, the Super Hornet is not currently certified to carry and launch the B61 nuclear weapons located in Germany, but Dan Gillian, head of Boeing's Super Hornet program, previously stated that \"We certainly think that we, working with the U.S. government, can meet the German requirements there on the [Germans'] timeline.\"[318] On 3 February 2022, reports started spreading around from a source close to the German military that a possible F-35 purchase was \"back on the table\", but no decisions were expected anytime soon.[319] On 14 March 2022, Germany's defense ministry officially announced its intention to purchase up to 35 F-35 to replace its ageing Tornado IDS in the controversial nuclear strike role.[320][321] The US State Department made a determination approving a possible Foreign Military Sale to the Government of Germany of F-35 Aircraft, Munitions, and related equipment for an estimated cost of $8.4 billion on 28 July 2022.[322] On 14 December 2022 funding was approved for a batch of procurements in Germany that included the F-35 deal.[323] The first jets are expected to be delivered to Germany in 2026 with initial operating capability being expected in 2028.[324] Japan's arms export ban has kept it out of the development phase of the F-35 project, which has contributed to the decline of its arms industries so Japan is considering an off the shelf purchase of the F-35 with no national industrial participation.[325][326] Lockheed Martin has offered final assembly of the Japanese F-35s to Japanese industry, along with \"maintenance, repair and upgrade capability\".[327] In October 2011 Lockheed upped the amount of workshare to be offered to the Japanese to include manufacture of major components and engine assembly.[328] This is because the United States government has now allowed Lockheed to reveal confidential technologies to Japanese firms.[329] On 20 December 2011 the Japanese Government announced that it intended to purchase 42 F-35s for approximately US$8 billion, with initial delivery to begin in 2016 to replace its existing F-4 Phantom II aircraft.[330] In order to fully participate in the program, the Japanese government is loosening their weapons export ban.[331] May 2012, a notification to Congress, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency outlined the details of the proposed Foreign Military Sales (FMS) deal, sale of 42 Lockheed Martin F-35A fighter aircraft to Japan at $10 billion.[332] In 2012 it was reported that the F-35s purchased after FY13 would include Japanese parts.[333] In 2013, the Japanese government decided that since Japanese companies would merely function as subcontractors that these parts would be exempt from the usual weapons export ban.[334] In August 2013, it was confirmed that Japanese companies will manufacture 24 components of the F-35 related to the engine and radar. Mitsubishi Electric will manufacture 7 components of the radar, and IHI Corporation will manufacture 17 fan and turbine components of the engine. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will also be included in some form in the manufacturing of the rear fuselage, wings, and undercarriage, which will allow Japanese industry to gain a greater understanding of low-observability stealth technology and manufacture. While four F-35As ordered in 2012 will be finished products, the two to be ordered in 2013 will have Japanese manufactured components. Technological insights gained from the manufacture of components related to stealth will most certainly be applied to the development of the indigenous Mitsubishi ATD-X.[335] In 2014, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries pressed for a Japanese government subsidy to manufacture F-35 parts for export.[336] The first four aircraft will be assembled in Texas, with the remainder built in Nagoya.[337] In July 2014, Japanese Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera unveiled plans to replace nearly 100 F-15Js not slated for upgrade with F-35s.[338] In September 2014 the Japanese government announced that it will develop its own stealth fighter, a design that will outperform the F-35. Harukazu Saito, chief of staff at the Air Self-Defense Force, stated, \"We can respond more quickly to an unpredictable situation that might happen to our fighters if they are made domestically than in the case of foreign-made fighters, and we can operate domestically made fighters more smoothly.\"[339] In December 2017, Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the Japanese government was considering modifying its Izumo-class helicopter destroyers to operate with roughly 10 F-35B aircraft. Multiple plans are reportedly under consideration, some of which call for US Marine Corps F-35s to use the vessels, but others for Japan to procure its own aircraft.[340][341] The plan quickly raised criticism from China, where government officials reacted negatively and urged Japan to \"act cautiously\".[342][343] In February 2018, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the Japanese government was also considering a purchase of F-35Bs for the defence of remote islands. Cited sources claim the Japanese government may already be considering a purchase in the 2019 defence budget, which could see the first deliveries in 2024, and operational capability from 2026.[344][345] In November 2018, Nikkei Asian Review reported that Japan was planning to order an additional 100 F-35 aircraft, including both the F-35A and F-35B variant, the latter not previously procured. The planned procurement of the F-35B is rumored to be associated with the currently researched possibility of deploying fixed-wing aircraft on the helicopter destroyers. The plans were reportedly in response of Chinese military build-up in the region.[346] In December 2018, the Japanese government approved the plan to procure an additional 105 F-35 aircraft, reportedly 63 of these are to be F-35A aircraft, and 42 F-35B aircraft. The plan increases Japan's total F-35 aircraft ordered to 147.[347][348] Initially, to save money, these additional aircraft were planned to not be assembled in Japan.[349] This decision was reversed in 2021, due to declining F-35 local production cost.[350] The United States has refused to share the F-35 software source code with its partners, despite their repeated requests for it.[351] However, in April 2019, the United States proposed disclosing portions of that source code with Japan, if Lockheed Martin is successful in its bid to develop the new Japanese F-3 stealth fighter; those portions of the F-35 software would be reused for the F-3.[352] On June 18, 2019, Japan's Ministry of Defense requested the Pentagon upgrade Japan's status as a customer to a full-fledge partner in the F-35 program. This request came near the time of Turkey's expulsion from the F-35 program. The letter, written by Atsuo Suzuki, director general for the Bureau of Defense Buildup Planning, and sent to Pentagon acquisition head Ellen Lord, stated, \"I believe becoming a partner country in F-35 program is an option. I would like to have your thoughts on whether or not Japan has a possibility to be a partner country in the first place. Also, I would like you to provide the Ministry of Defense with detailed information about the responsibilities and rights of a partner country, as well as cost sharing and conditions such as the approval process and the required period. We would like to make a final decision whether we could proceed to become a partner country by thoroughly examining the rights and obligations associated with becoming a partner country based on the terms and conditions you would provide.\" The request was welcomed by some officials of the program due to Turkey's expulsion as a partner and Japan's commitment to being the second largest buyer of F-35s. However, it is likely that the request would be denied due to political reasons, as this would allow other \"customer nations\" to petition for partner-level status; creating further complications in the F-35 program.[353] In June 2020, Japan Marine United started work on refitting the first of two JMSDF Izumo-class helicopter destroyers for operations with the F-35B, confirming rumors of planned naval operation.[354] On 9 July 2020, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced that the US Department of State has approved a potential US$23.11 billion sale of 105 F-35 aircraft to Japan - 63 F-35As and 42 F-35Bs, along with related equipment and services. This is in addition to the 42 F-35A already ordered.[355] This would be the second-largest foreign military sale ever by the US.[356] The deal still needs approval by the US Congress.[355] \"This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a major ally that is a force for political stability and economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region\", the DSCA said. \"It is vital to U.S. national interest to assist Japan in developing and maintaining a strong and effective self-defense capability\". It added that \"the proposed sale of aircraft and support will augment Japan's operational aircraft inventory and enhance its air-to-air and air-to-ground self-defense capability. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force's F-4 aircraft are being decommissioned as F-35s are added to the inventory. Japan will have no difficulty absorbing these aircraft into its armed forces.\"[356] The DSCA also stated that the proposed deal \"will not alter the basic military balance in the region\".[355] (¥ billion) (+ ¥ 0.00) (+ 0) (+ 0) (+ 0) On 6 February 2014, the Polish Ministry of National Defence set out a budget in which its interests include buying 64 fifth-generation multi-role fighters that will not include the previous F-16 Fighting Falcon deals. Possible options are reportedly 64 F-35 fighters from 2021 to replace the MiG-29s operated by the Polish Air Force.[373][374] In June 2017, the Polish Deputy Defence Minister announced plans to acquire fifth-generation combat aircraft by around 2025 under a new project named \"Harpia\", which aims to replace Poland's ageing fleet of Sukhoi Su-22 and Mikoyan MiG-29 aircraft. Officials have stated this may mean a purchase of two squadrons of F-35 aircraft, totaling 32 aircraft, but that Poland is also looking into used US Air Force F-16s.[375][376] In February 2019, Poland's Minister of Defence Mariusz Błaszczak announced the signing of a military modernization plan, which includes the procurement of 32 fifth-generation aircraft as a priority procurement. The minister added he expected senior military staff to initiate action on this task immediately.[377][378] In April 2019, U.S. Vice Admiral and head of the Pentagon's F-35 office Mathias Winter submitted a written testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives in which Poland was identified as a \"future potential Foreign Military Sales customer\".[379] Later that day Poland's Minister of Defence Błaszczak stated that \"Since the US side talks about it publicly, it means the purchase can be accelerated\", adding \"I am happy with this information. It is not a surprise, because we have already started negotiations. I have prepared the legal and financial basis to acquire at least 32 fifth-generation combat aircraft\".[380] On 25 April during a visit to Warsaw, U.S. Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said that a U.S. Air Force team was to visit Poland in May in order to demonstrate the F-35s capabilities. A few days later, Polish Minister of Defence Błaszczak stated on a televised interview that the signing of a contract to purchase F-35 jets was \"not far away\". Błaszczak implied the signing of the contract could coincide with the signing of a contract to permanently base U.S. troops in Poland, which is scheduled to be agreed before the end of the year.[381] On 28 May 2019, the Polish Minister of Defence announced that Poland had sent a request for quotation for the acquisition of 32 F-35A aircraft.[382] On 11 September 2019, the Department of Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced that Poland had been cleared to purchase 32 F-35A fighters, along with associated equipment, for an estimated cost of $6.5 billion.[383] On 27 September 2019 the US Congress approved the sale.[384] On 31 January 2020, during a ceremony attended by the Polish President, Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and the US ambassador to Poland,[385] Poland's acquisition efforts concluded with signing of a $4.6 billion deal for procurement of 32 F-35A Block 4 jets[385][386] with Technology Refresh 3 software update[387] and drogue parachutes, for an average unit price of $87.3 million net.[385][386] In addition to the 32 jets, the deal encompasses also:[385][386] The initial deliveries of the F-35s are expected to begin in 2024 with in-country deliveries to start in 2026.[385][386] Yearly, 4 to 6 units are expected to be delivered, concluding deliveries in 2030.[385][386] Reaching the IOC will be possible after delivery of at least 8 units together with the associated additional equipment and finalization of training of the associated personnel.[385][386] The first 6 planes will be stationed in Ebbing Air National Guard Base, for training of the Polish Armed Forces personnel.[385][386] After delivery, the jets are expected to be based in Łask Air Base, Poland.[385][386] The first Polish F-35 \"Husarz\" was unveiled during an official ceremony at Fort Worth attended by Polish and American military and government officials on 28 August 2024.[388] South Korea started considering the F-35 in 2009, among several other competitors, for its F-X Phase III fighter program.[389][390] South Korean officials had indicated that the F-35 would only be available for delivery after 2018, but Steve O'Bryan, Lockheed's vice president for F-35 business development, said at that time that Lockheed could deliver the F-35 to South Korea by 2016.[391] Some Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) officers have outlined possible missions for the stealth fighter, such as surprise raids deep into nuclear armed North Korea.[392] Lockheed has refused to allow ROKAF pilots access to the aircraft to test it prior to the selection,[393] however simulations available to South Korea are more extensive than the processes used by other customers, such as Israel and Japan.[394] In August 2013, the F-35 was essentially eliminated from the competition when the American foreign military sales process prevented Lockheed Martin from offering a price that did not exceed South Korea's budget for the program, leaving just the Boeing F-15SE Silent Eagle within the nation's budget.[395][396][397][398] Lockheed Martin responded that it would work with the American government to continue to offer the F-35 to South Korea.[399] The defense ministry rejected the award and said a new competition would be held to \"secure military capability in line with recent aviation technology developments\".[400] In November 2013, the Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff Council recommended purchasing 40 F-35A as North Korea seemed to have difficulty dealing with radar-evading aircraft.[401] On 27 January 2014, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration said that a contract for the 40 aircraft would be reviewed and, once approved, signed in September.[402] With deliveries planned to begin in 2018, South Korea would benefit from the scale of F-35 production at the time. With full-scale production having begun, the Unit Recurring Flyaway (URF) cost of one F-35A is expected to be $80–$85 million, which includes the aircraft, avionics and mission systems, the engine, logistics support, and a flight simulator. Through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) agreement and past budget issues, the cost projection may be likely to rise.[403] South Korea's formal selection of the F-35 purchase was finalized on 24 September 2014. South Korea is the third FMS country to procure the F-35A after Israel and Japan.[404] In December 2017, Korean media reported that the Defense Acquisition Program Administration had established a process for acquiring an additional 20 F-35 aircraft, in addition to the 40 it had already ordered in 2014.[405] The first F-35A was delivered in Fort Worth, Texas on 28 March 2018. The aircraft will remain in the US as South Korean crews will begin training with the aircraft at Luke Air Force Base. The arrival of the first F-35s in South Korea occurred in March 2019, when two F-35As were delivered to a base in Cheongju.[406][407][408] In December 2019, 13 F-35A of 17th Fighter Wing has declared as operational within the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF).[409] The Swiss Air Force sought a replacement for its current fleet of Northrop F-5 and McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet aircraft. These aircraft had been scheduled to be replaced by the Saab Gripen, but this was blocked by Swiss voters in a 2014 referendum.[410] In response, the Swiss government launched the Air 2030 program, seeking again to find a replacement aircraft. In March 2018, Swiss officials named the contenders in its Air 2030 program: The Saab Gripen E (disqualified in June 2019 as it was considered not ready to perform all tests[411]), Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the Lockheed Martin F-35. The program has a budget of US$8 billion to cover both combat aircraft and ground-based air defense systems.[412][413] In October 2018, it was reported by Jane's that the Swiss Air Force may limit the purchase to a single-engine fighter for budgetary reasons.[414] A team of four F-35s performed demonstrations for Swiss personnel at Payerne Air Base in June 2019. The aircraft was evaluated in a series of eight flights and compared with flights performed by other bidders.[415][416] The Swiss population was asked whether or not to proceed with Air 2030 program in a referendum on 27 September 2020. The program was approved with a very slim margin of less than 9,000 votes.[417] On 30 June 2021 the Swiss Federal Council proposed the acquisition of 36 F-35As to Parliament[418] at a cost of up to 6 billion Swiss francs (US$6.5 billion), citing the aircraft's cost- and combat-effectiveness.[419] However, it was later confirmed that the costs were capped for a period of just 10 years.[420] It has also been reported that the operating costs would have been reduced by replacing some actual flying with bundled simulators.[421] As in other countries, there have also been complaints that the F-35 is 3 dB louder than the F/A-18C/D,[422] and the Liberal Greens promised to examine its environmental impact.[423][424] The Swiss anti-military group GSoA also intended to contest the purchase in another national referendum supported by the Green Party of Switzerland and the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland (which previously managed to block the Gripen).[425][426] In August 2022, they registered the initiative, with 120,000 people having signed in less than a year (with 100,000 required).[427] The budget was narrowly approved by single majority, but rejecting the selection would have required a double majority.[428][429][430][431] On November 26, 2021, it was announced that Armasuisse had agreed to contract terms with the US government for 36 F-35As for CHF 6.035 billion. The next step was to request Parliament approve funds in the 2022 Armed Forces Dispatch.[432] The order was then subject to parliamentary approval and the popular initiative not proceeding or failing. A parliamentary inquiry found the purchase worrisome but legal.[428][433] The government did not wait for the popular initiative to proceed, which was legally permitted.[434] On 15 September 2022 the Swiss National council gave the Federal council permission to sign the purchase deal, with a time limit for signing of March 2023.[435] The deal to buy 36 F-35A was signed on 19 September 2022, with deliveries to commence in 2027 and conclude by 2030.[436][437] On 20 September 2022 the popular initiative was withdrawn, due to the contract signing.[438] The Czech Air Force has been offered 24 F-35As to replace their leased 14 JAS 39 Gripens, as their lease expires in 2027 or 2029.[439] On 3 November 2021, Janes reported the Czech Republic's requirement for 40 aircraft, with the F-35 being offered as an option.[440][441] On 20 July 2022 the Czech government announced that they intend to begin the process of procuring 24 F-35s.[442] On 30 June 2023, US State Department approved sale of 24 F-35 fighters for the Czech Republic.[443] The plan for the purchase of the aircraft, staff training, ammunition, fuel as well as upgrades to the Čáslav Air Base was approved on 27 September 2023. The total cost is CZK 150 billion or $6.47 billion. According to Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, the first fighters would be ready in 2029 and the others by 2035.[444][445] On 29 January 2024, the Czech government signed a memorandum of understanding with the United States for the purchase of 24 F-35A fighters. The deal is valued at $5.6 billion with the first deliveries beginning in 2031 and full operational capability in 2035.[446] Lockheed Martin offered the F-35 to Greece's Hellenic Air Force as a replacement for F-4E Peace Icarus 2000 and F-16C/D Block 30 aircraft in 2009.[447] As of October 2017, largely due to the Greek government-debt crisis, Greece has decided to upgrade the Hellenic Air Force's fleet of ageing General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft, and to postpone a decision on further procurement until the 2020s. The F-35 was reportedly still on the table, and if economically viable by the 2020 timeframe, plans call for a purchase of 15 to 20 aircraft.[448][449] In April 2019, U.S. Vice Admiral and head of the Pentagon's F-35 office Mathias Winter submitted a written testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives in which Greece was identified as a \"future potential Foreign Military Sales customer\".[379] Later the same day, Greek defense minister Evangelos Apostolakis stated that Greece would consider the possibility of acquiring the F-35 as part of its efforts to upgrade the Hellenic Air Force fleet.[450][451] In January 2020, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis visited Donald Trump in the White House and discussed Greece's interest in the F-35.[452] In the following days, Greece's Minister for National Defence Nikos Panagiotopoulos announced that, alongside upgrading Greece's fleet of F-16s, Greece is looking to procure 24 F-35 aircraft at an estimated cost of US$3 billion.[453][454] On October 10, 2021, the Greek Minister of Defense, Nikos Panagiotopoulos, stated that \"The requirement of the Greek Armed Forces to adequately cover the Defense needs of the country is for 48 new-gen aircraft, as well as for 12 to 13 frigates with maybe some corvettes\". Sources claim that the requirement for 48 aircraft may not include the recently acquired 24 Rafales.[455] Then on November 20, 2021, he directly addressed the potential acquisition of the F-35, saying \"(...)when we are preparing and discussing possibly the procurement of a Fifth Generation F-35 aircraft - at some point we will enter this discussion - (...)\"[456] which confirmed a report from Janes on November 3, 2021, that Greece continues to be \"in active campaign\" for the F-35.[457] On 30 June 2022, Greece's prime minister confirmed that the country has sent a request to the U.S. for the purchase of 20 F-35s, with the option of buying a second group of jets also being examined. The expected delivery date is 2027–2028.[458] On 27 January 2024, the US State Department formally approved Greece's request for sale of up to 40 conventional variants for $8.6 billion.[459] The procurement program was finalized on 25 July 2024 with the signing of Letter of Offer and Acceptance for 20 F-35s. The LOA also includes the option to buy an additional 20 F-35s in the future.[460] In 2012, the Romanian Ministry of Defence expressed interest in buying the F-35 for its air force sometime after 2020. This proposal was based on an earlier plan from 2010 which called for the acquisition of 24 F-35 fighters that would enter service when the first lot of F-16s was retired.[461] In October 2017, Romania's Minister of National Defence stated that Romania was targeting one squadron of F-35 aircraft as part of a 10-year program spanning 2017 to 2026.[462][463] In April 2019, U.S. Vice Admiral and head of the Pentagon's F-35 office Mathias Winter submitted a written testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives in which Romania was identified as a \"future potential Foreign Military Sales customer\".[379] Later that month, Romania's Minister of National Defence Gabriel-Beniamin Leș [ro] commented on the news during an announcement to procure additional ex-Portuguese F-16s that it would be \"a bit too much\" for Romania.[464] On 2 February 2022, the President of Romania stated the intent to purchase the F-35 as part of the Air Force modernization program, which plans to spend a total of 9.8 billion euros until 2026 to boost its defense capabilities.[465] Soon after, then Minister of Defence Vasile Dîncu responded that the acquisition procedure for the F-35 will start from 2032.[466] During the Black Sea Defense & Aerospace [ro] 2022 exposition, Lockheed Martin brought an F-35 simulator, and a scale model of the F-35 in Romanian markings was displayed.[467] In March 2023, the chief of the General Directorate for Armaments, Major-General Teodor Incicaș, stated in an interview that the first steps of the procedure are to start in 2023 or 2024, with the first F-35 squadron to be operational after 2030.[468] On 11 April 2023, the F-35 acquisition procedure was approved following a meeting of the Romanian Supreme Council of National Defense.[469] In June 2023, a Romanian delegation together with the Chief of the Romanian Air Force Staff, Lieutenant general Viorel Pană, took part in a tour hosted by the 187th Fighter Wing. The tour provided Romania with insight on the F-35 conversion process, as the 187th Fighter Wing was set to receive the fifth-generation fighter aircraft in December 2023.[470] After a request for the purchase was sent to the Parliament on 9 August,[471] the F-35 program was approved on 24 October. According to a statement given by Angel Tîlvăr, the Minister of Defence, if the acceptance letter will be signed in 2024, the first F-35s are to arrive in 2032. A total of 48 aircraft are desired for equipping three squadrons.[472] According to General Incicaș, the acceptance letter was sent to the United States in November 2023.[473] On 26 September, it was announced that the first phase of the contract, worth $6.5 billion, will consist of 32 aircraft as well as logistical support and training services, engines, flight simulators, ammunition. Another 16 aircraft will be procured in a second phase.[474][475] Industrial cooperation and technology transfers to Romanian companies are also included in the agreement.[476] The draft law for acquiring the F-35 was published by the Romanian Army in August 2024. According to this draft, the F-16s will start to be retired in 2034 and by 2040, Romania will only operate the F-35.[477] The contract for the F-35 purchase is expected to be signed sometime between October 2024 and January 2025.[478] The possible Foreign Military Sale of F-35s to Romania for an estimated $7.2 billion, although the final price will be around $6.4 billion, was approved by the US State Department on 13 September 2024.[479][480] After it was approved by the Government, then passed through the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, the law for purchasing the F-35s was promulgated by President Iohannis on 15 November.[481] The Letter of Offer and Acceptance contract for the first stage of the program was signed by the Romanian Minister of Defence Angel Tîlvăr and the US Ambassador to Romania Kathleen Kavalec on 21 November 2024.[482][483] In 2010, the Indian Navy received a briefing from Lockheed Martin on the F-35 via an RFI.[484] In January 2018, sources in the Indian Ministry of Defence were reportedly considering the possibility of an order for the F-35, and a request for information should follow at an unknown later date.[485] In February 2018, it was reported that the Indian Air Force was interested in the procurement of 126 F-35As, and that a classified briefing by Lockheed Martin had been requested. Any deal would have to include partial local manufacturing facilities as per Indian legislation as part of the Make in India initiative.[486][487] In March 2018, Indian Air Force Chief of the Air Staff Birender Singh Dhanoa clarified that no request was made for the F-35, nor for a classified briefing.[488][489][490] Soon after, however, US Navy Admiral and United States Pacific Command commander Harry B. Harris Jr. came out in support of a potential F-35 sale to India, stating that the US Pacific Command supports a series of potential sales, including the F-35.[491][492] In February 2025, President Donald Trump stated in a joint news conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he would offer to sell the F-35 to India. However, Trump clarified that the offer was only in the proposal stage and would be part of a larger tranche of military sales to India.[493][494] Furthermore, during his first official visit to India in April 2025, Vice President Vance expressed his admiration for the Indian Air Force and reaffirmed his government's strong support for India's acquisition of the F-35, emphasizing the jet’s unmatched capabilities to enhance India’s national defense.[495] However, in late July 2025, Bloomberg reported that India has already rejected its requirement of the aircraft. While the Indian Ministry of Defence has not confirmed any of this, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs maintained that India has not held any formal discussions about the aircraft's procurement with the USA.[496][497] In the late 2010s, the Portuguese Ministry of National Defense and the Portuguese Air Force began openly considering replacing their F-16s with a fifth-generation fighter by 2030, when their F-16s reach their service retirement age.[498][499] Portugal, having only received their F-16s in 1994 with a mid-life upgrade by the Air Force and OGMA in 2001, was not in any particular rush to procure a replacement compared to other European countries operating older-generation or non-stealth aircraft.[500] The Portuguese Military Programming law,[501] signed in 2019, points to roughly 2027 as the year funds are allocated to the Air Force for procurement. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa was also aware of the need to plan the F-16's replacement.[502][503][504] In 2020, the Portuguese Air Force developed a technological solution capable of integrating the data transmission of JTACs with the F-35 platform.[505] On November 27, 2023, the Portuguese Air Force unveiled its \"Air Force 5.3.\" program, which includes the acquisition of 5th generation fighters, UAVs, and light attack aircraft.[506] In November 2023, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force announced that the F-35 was chosen to replace the F-16.[507][508] An analysis article published in February 2024 by Janes mentioned Portugal as one of the possible future operators of 28 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters.[509] In May 2024, the Portuguese Chief of Staff of the Air Force further clarified that the intention was to purchase 27 F-35s for an estimated cost of 5.5 billion euros.[510] In an April 2024 interview with the news Diário de Notícias, General Cartaxo Alves of the Portuguese Air Force announced the Air Force had already started the transition to the F-35, and a workshop on this transition for the fifth-generation fighter was held in conjunction with Lockheed Martin and United States Air Force.[511][512] Lockheed Martin was present at Monte Real Air Base (where Portugal's F-16s are based) with an F-35 cockpit simulator in September 2024, during the celebration of 30 years of F-16 service in Portugal.[513] On March 13, 2025, following disputes between the U.S. and the EU and regarding NATO spending goals and a looming trade war, Portuguese Minister of National Defence Nuno Melo announced Portugal was no longer actively seeking to procure the F-35 to replace their F-16s in the foreseeable future and that the Portuguese Air Force would likely purchase a European fighter jet instead.[514][515] Melo cited the \"predictability\" of European countries compared to the U.S. under President Donald Trump as the primary reason, but clarified that this decision did not change Portugal's stance on the U.S. as a close ally.[514] On March 31, Major General João Nogueira, director of the weapons systems maintenance directorate, confirmed that the F-35 continues to be considered as a possible replacement jet for the F16 fighter.[516][517] After several news reports that pointed to Portugal's withdrawal from the purchase of the F35 fighter, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, on April 22, 2025, admitted that the F35 fighter is the only fighter that allows a technological advance in relation to the F-16, with Portugal having no alternative but to acquire the F-35.[518][519] In October 2020, Qatar issued a formal request to discuss a potential purchase of the F-35 for the Qatar Emiri Air Force, but the U.S. government has a policy of providing Israel with a qualitative military edge, making such a purchase extremely unlikely.[520] In March 2012, The Saudi Ministry of Defense was said to be keeping all options open for future fighter jet purchases, including notably the Boeing F-15SE Silent Eagle and the Lockheed Martin F-35.[521] In November 2017, Saudi Arabia again expressed interest in the F-35, following a similar expression from the United Arab Emirates a few days prior.[522][523] The potential sale of F-35 aircraft drew criticism with regards to maintaining Israel's qualitative military edge, a policy enshrined in U.S. law, as well as concerns regarding human rights violations during the Yemeni Civil War and Saudi Arabia's role therein. Additionally, concerns have been raised that procurement of the F-35 could spark a regional arms race.[524][525] The Spanish Navy amphibious assault ship Juan Carlos I is adapted to carry JSF and AV-8B Harrier.[526] JSF Program Executive Officer Air Force Major General Charles Davis said in 2008 that discussions had been held with Spain, which could eventually lead to the F-35B replacing the Spanish Navy's EAV-8B Harrier fleet.[527] In 2014 Spain decided to extend the lifespan of the Harriers to beyond 2025 as funding was not available to replace the type.[528][529] In November 2014 the Council of Ministers approved a section of 47.6 million euros to extend that of the AV-8B of the Spanish navy until 2034, the date on which the BPE Juan Carlos I is close to its withdrawal. It is not necessary to replace the AV-8B[530] In 2017 it was reported that the Spanish Air Force and Navy had a preference for the F-35 as a replacement for the Harrier and Hornet fighters. The decision needed to be reached by 2018 at the latest. It was expected to be one of the priorities of the Armed Forces Capacity Objective.[531] On November 22, 2017, the defense ministry declares that Spain is not interested in buying the F-35 in any of its variants[532] In April 2019, U.S. Vice Admiral and head of the Pentagon's F-35 office Mathias Winter submitted a written testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives in which Spain was identified as a \"future potential Foreign Military Sales customer\".[379] In June 2019, it was reported that the Spanish Navy and Spanish Air Force were as of May that year in the beginning stages of an analysis in which the F-35 is a key contender. The Spanish Navy is looking for the F-35B to replace its amphibious assault ship-based Harrier VTOL aircraft, and the Spanish Air Force is investigating the F-35A to replace its aging fleet of F-18 Hornet aircraft.[533] In March 2021, socialist deputy Zaida Cantera, spokesperson for the Defense Commission in Congress, stated: \"The F-35 Bravo is a purely American aircraft. This purchase does not serve Europe. Strategic autonomy is important not only for military reasons, but also because European money finances industry, employment, research and technology in Europe.\"[534] On 9 November 2021, the Defense Ministry stated that there are no plans to join the F-35 project as Spain is fully committed to the FCAS.[535] However, on 15 November 2021, Greg Ulmer, Lockheed Martin's Vice President of Aeronautics, revealed that the Spanish government remains in contact with Lockheed Martin about a potential acquisition of F-35B jets, as the only possible replacement for fixed-wing fighter aircraft, for Spain's aging fleet of 13 VTOL Harrier II jets which operate from Spain's amphibious assault ship. Ulmer also stressed that \"discussions with Spain were in the preliminary stages and had not progressed into classified briefings\".[536] Ukraine has expressed interest in the F-35.[537] On 12 March 2020, Bloomberg reported that Indonesia canceled the Su-35 deal due to United States pressure. Indonesia is instead looking to negotiate the purchase of F-35 aircraft.[538] On 18 March 2020, Indonesia's Deputy Defense Minister Sakti Wahyu Trenggono confirmed that the government could consider the purchase of the F-35.[539] On 15 October 2020, Indonesian defense minister Prabowo was told by the Trump administration that the US had refused to sell the F-35s to Indonesia, citing \"production backlog\" and \"a 9-years waiting time.\"[540] It has been reported that the US has agreed to sell F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, F-15Es or F-16Vs instead of the F-35.[541] In February 2022, the US State Department approved the sale of up to 36 F-15IDs, a proposed export version of the F-15EX Eagle II for the Indonesian Air Force, and related equipment to Indonesia worth around $13.9 billion.[542] Taiwan has requested to buy the F-35 from the US. However; this has been rejected by the US in fear of a critical response from China. In March 2009, Taiwan again was looking to buy U.S. fifth-generation fighter jets featuring stealth and vertical takeoff capabilities.[citation needed] However, in September 2011, during a visit to the US, the Deputy Minister of National Defense of Taiwan confirmed that while the country was busy upgrading its current F-16s it was still also looking to procure a next-generation aircraft such as the F-35. This received the usual critical response from China.[543] Taiwan renewed its push for an F-35 purchase under the Presidency of Donald Trump in early 2017, again causing criticism from China.[544][545] In March 2018, Taiwan once again reiterated its interest in the F-35 in light of an anticipated round of arms procurement from the United States. The F-35B STOVL variant is reportedly the political favorite as it would allow the Republic of China Air Force to continue operations after its limited number of runways were to be bombed in an escalation with the People's Republic of China.[546][547] Following this renewed interest, senior U.S. senators publicly called for the sale of the F-35 to Taiwan as it would \"retain a democracy in the face of threats from China\".[548][549] In April 2018, however, it became clear that the U.S. government was reluctant about selling the F-35 to Taiwan over worries of Chinese spies within the Taiwanese military, possibly compromising classified data concerning the aircraft and granting Chinese military officials access.[550] In November 2018, it was reported that Taiwanese military leadership had abandoned the procurement of the F-35 in favor of a larger number of F-16V Viper aircraft. The decision was reportedly motivated by concerns about industry independence, as well as cost and previously raised espionage concerns.[551][552][553][554] In 2010, the United Arab Emirates requested information about a possible sale of F-35s, however the United States delayed responding for months.[555][556] The United States continued to decline requests by Gulf States including the United Arab Emirates until as late as 2015.[557] In early November 2017, the Trump administration agreed to consider the continued request by the United Arab Emirates for preliminary talks concerning potential sale of the F-35.[558][559][560] Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force Stephen W. Wilson confirmed on 11 November that preliminary talks were taking place with regional partner nations, later adding that included the United Arab Emirates.[561] The potential sale of the F-35 to the United Arab Emirates raised concerns about maintaining Israel's Qualitative Military Edge, a policy also enshrined in US law.[560][561] Additional skepticism was raised by senior US Air Force and Central Command personnel concerning the United Arab Emirates Air Force's plan to also jointly develop and procure a fifth-generation combat aircraft with Russia.[562] In November 2019, at the Dubai Air Show, US officials denied that the United Arab Emirates was a potential export nation.[563] In October 2020, the White House announced that the U.S. intended to sell 50 F-35s to the UAE. Due to the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and the UAE, Israel indicated it has no objections to a potential deal.[564] On 10 November 2020, the Donald Trump administration sent a formal notification to the United States Congress about the sale of 50 F-35s to the United Arab Emirates, under an arms deal worth $23 billion. On 1 December 2020, the Human Rights Watch called to the US to stop selling weapons to the UAE, including the sale of F-35s. This advanced arms sale to the UAE was viewed by the Human Rights Watch as a threat to the humanitarian situation in conflict zones such as Yemen.[565][566][567] The UAE signed the deal to acquire 50 F-35s on 20 January 2021, just before the inauguration of Joe Biden as US president.[568] After pausing the bill to review the sale, the Biden administration confirmed to move forward with the deal on 13 April 2021.[569] In December 2021, the United Arab Emirates unilaterally suspended talks with the US regarding the procurement, stating that technical requirements, sovereign operational restrictions, and cost/benefit analysis led to the re-assessment and suspension of the deal.[570] The Royal Thai Air Force is seeking for multirole fighter to replace F-16A/B Block 15 ADF in service. On 31 December 2021, the RTAF Commander-in-chief announced that the Air Force proposes buying 8 to 12 F-35As in 2023. On 12 January 2022, Thailand's cabinet approved a budget for the first four F-35A, estimated at 13.8 billion baht in FY2023.[571][572][573] On 22 May 2023, the United States Department of Defense has implied it will turn down Thailand's bid to buy F-35 fighter jets, and instead offer F-16 Block 70/72 Viper and F-15EX Eagle II fighters, a Royal Thai Air Force source said.[574] Estimated cost of airplane in Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) batches: LRIP-12 was initially to be the first FRP batch. This has been delayed by the Pentagon 400th Jet delivered in June 2019. Full TR-3 capability was delayed due to software instability and supply chain bottlenecks, among other issues. Full TR-3 capability is expected in 2026.[594] Lot 15 was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[595] Confirmed orders to purchase the F-35.[605][606] Countries with on-going fighter jet procurement programs, who are considering the F-35 as a potential choice in their respective procurement programs. No final contract, nor resolute commitment made towards acquiring the F-35. Listed countries are actively engaged with Lockheed Martin and the U.S. in regards to the F-35. Initial production orders to date.[626] In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the F-35 global production and supply chain. In April 2020, Lockheed Martin announced an alternate week work schedule to compensate for the delay in getting supplies from vendors and entered into an agreement with International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers to use an alternate week work schedule.[631]"}

The first nine F-35s became operational with the Israeli Air Force in December 2017.[1] On 22 May 2018, Israeli Air Force commander, Major General Amikam Norkin, reported that Israel had become the first country in the world to use the F-35 in combat.[2] They were also used in the Gaza war. In November 2020, an F-35I testbed aircraft was delivered. This was the only example of a testbed F-35 delivered to an air force outside of the United States.[3][4] As of 13 November 2022, the Israeli Air Force had 36 F-35s in service, including the testbed stationed at the Flight Test Center at Tel Nof Airbase, and operated three squadrons at Nevatim Airbase – the 140th, 116th and 117th.[5] The IAF's initial plans were to send pilots to the US in 2016 to begin training on the F-35 together with American pilots, and to take the first deliveries of F-35s in late 2016 or early 2017.[6] It was announced in March 2013 that Israel would receive its first F-35s in 2015.[7] The Israeli F-35s are based at Nevatim Airbase in the Negev.[8] The decision was based on operational, environmental, infrastructure and training considerations, as well as the IDF's strategic vision to transfer some of its bases to the region.[9] In 2013, it was reported that Israel was building the infrastructure needed to accommodate F-35s, including hardened aircraft shelters, underground pens, and maintenance facilities. The IAF also ordered 30 M-346 trainer jets to train F-35 pilots.[10] Construction of a manufacturing facility to produce wings under license for the F-35 was expected to be completed by mid-2014. The site was to produce a total of 811 wing pairs. Initial orders of the F-35 were for 20 planes, with a total of 75 intended.[11] In May 2017, it was reported that the first customized F-35I test platform was expected to be delivered to Israel by 2020.[12] Former Israel Air Force chief Maj.-Gen. (res.) Amir Eshel has called the F-35 \"game changing,\" saying that Israel gathered new intelligence during a single flight by the F-35 in early 2017 that other reconnaissance and intelligence gathering systems would take weeks to gather.[13] The IAF had received nine aircraft and declared the fleet operational on 6 December 2017.[14][15] A senior Israeli air force official stated, \"the aircraft will be designated F-35I, as there will be unique Israeli features installed in them.\" The United States initially refused to allow the integration of Israel's own electronic warfare systems into the aircraft's built-in electronic suite. However, Israel planned the introduction of a plug-and-play feature added to the main computer to allow for the use of Israeli electronics in an add-on fashion, and to fit its own external jamming pod.[16] The IAF dispatched two officers to the US where they discussed issues involving the integration of Israeli technology into the fighter with Pentagon and Lockheed Martin officials.[6] In July 2011, it was reported that the U.S. had agreed to allow Israel to install its own electronic warfare systems and missiles in its F-35s in the future.[17] In 2012 Lockheed was awarded a contract to make changes to the first Israeli F-35s to allow the installation of Israeli electronic warfare equipment produced by Elbit Systems.[18][19] This equipment will use \"specific apertures ... in the lower fuselage and leading edge\".[20] Israel also plans to install its own indigenously produced guided bombs and air-to-air missiles in the F-35's internal weapons bay.[16] Benni Cohen compared the Israel Aerospace Industries command and control system to an iPhone App that would run on top of the central avionics.[21] Israel Aerospace Industries was to manufacture the outer wings of Israel's F-35s.[19] IAI may also play a role in the development of a proposed two-seat F-35. An IAI executive stated, \"There is a known demand for two seats not only from Israel but from other air forces. Advanced aircraft are usually two seats rather than single seats.\"[22] The Israeli F-35s helmet-mounted displays were also to be manufactured in Israel.[23] This is part of the Offset agreement provided to Israel, in spite of the purchase being entirely funded by American aid.[24] In June 2012, Aviation Week quoted an IAF official stating that while the stealth of the F-35 in its current form was to be overcome in 5–10 years, the aircraft was planned to be in service for 30–40 years, and that is the reason that Israel insisted on the ability to make its own changes to the aircraft's electronic warfare systems.[25] In March 2014, Channel 12 reported that during the U.S. outfitting of F-35As for nuclear weapons delivery, a senior U.S. official declined to comment on if Israel had requested similar modifications to its F-35Is.[26] On 9 December 2016, it was reported that the first 19 aircraft were to be delivered as standard F-35As with the remaining 31 to be fully equipped F-35Is.[27] In 2003, Israel signed a formal letter of agreement, worth almost $20 million, to join the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) effort for the F-35 as a \"security cooperation participant\" (SCP).[28] The Israeli Air Force stated in 2006 that the F-35 was a key part of its recapitalization plans, and that Israel intended to buy over 100 F-35A fighters at an estimated cost of over $5 billion to replace their F-16s over time.[29] Israel was reinstated as a partner in the development of the F-35 on 31 July 2006, after its participation was put on hold following the Chinese arms deal crisis.[30] On 16 November 2006, Yaakov Katz of the Jerusalem Post reported that if no jet fighters were delivered to Israel between the last batch of F-16s in 2007 and the first F-35s in 2014 then the IAF would decline in numbers as older fighters wore out and were retired.[31] On 1 June, it was reported that Rafael Advanced Defense Systems was developing smaller versions of the Python and Derby missiles for carriage within the aircraft, while Israel Military Industries was developing a penetration bomb in the same configuration as the Mk 82 500 lb bomb.[32] However these were put off in order to rush the aircraft into operation as part of Israel's response to Iran's nuclear ambitions.[33] On 26 July 2010, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that he would insist on Israeli industrial participation, including local electronic warfare parts, and weapons, during his trip to the United States.[34] Barak submitted a request to the Israeli cabinet for 20 F-35s for $2.75 billion to be delivered starting in 2015. This included the costs of setting up local firms to assemble the aircraft and manufacture spare parts.[35][36] The package was to be paid for with American military assistance.[37][38] Former head of the IAF, retired Major General Eitan Ben Eliyahu, called the American approval of the deal a key test of Israel – United States relations.[39] The F-35 is the fighter plane of the future that will allow Israel to maintain its aerial superiority and its technological advantage in the region ... The F-35 will give the IAF better capabilities, both near and far, to help strengthen Israel's national security. The F-35 deal was pushed through, instead of upgrading the Israeli Air Force's F-15s and F-16s, in a bid to maintain Israel's technological advantage over Arab states. This approach adheres to the Israeli principle that Israel ought to be the first country in the Middle East to receive new fighter aircraft. The IAF was sufficiently committed to this principle to override protests from the leaders of Israeli defense contractors, who claimed that the deal would damage them. A number of members of the Israeli General Staff also criticized the high cost of the deal, which would reduce the funds available for investment in weapons for the land forces and navy.[40] These aircraft will be designated F-35I, as there will be unique Israeli features installed in them.[41] The total price tag confirmed by Barak indicated that each aircraft costs about $96 million, with further expenses on training, simulators, spare parts, and the building of maintenance infrastructure. The first squadron of 20 F-35 jets, from the first production series, only included a few Israeli-made systems. The United States agreed to allow the installation of more Israeli-made systems if Israel purchased further F-35 squadrons from later production series. To sweeten the deal, Lockheed Martin said it would buy parts and systems for the F-35 from Israeli companies at a cost of $4 billion. Defense Ministry Director-General Udi Shani said that, apart from the jet's operational capacity, a significant factor in closing the deal included agreements that would include Israeli defense contractors in producing the F-35 for other clients.[40] Israel's three main areas of interest in customization were radar, electronic warfare and communications systems and independent maintenance capabilities.[42] Richard Genaille, deputy head of the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency, has said that installing different electronics on the F-35 would be very costly and \"probably will not be in the best interest in the long run of\" nations that make such changes.[43] Israel's guarantees of more than US$4B of aerospace work in exchange for their purchase of 20 F-35s valued at US$2.7B, without any other industrial investment in the program has caused aerospace analysts to question what benefits countries who have invested in the F-35 program will receive. Norway, Denmark and Italy have all expressed concerns that the industrial benefits from the program may be insufficient to justify participation.[44] On 16 September 2010, a ministerial panel headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak made a final decision to purchase 20 F-35 fighter jets, despite opposition from a number of senior defense officials over the high cost of the deal.[45] On 7 October 2010, Ehud Shani, director general of the Israeli Ministry of Defense signed the deal while in New York City. Israel was to get 20 of the warplanes for nearly $3 billion and receive the jets in 2016, while retaining an option for the purchase of additional 75 aircraft.[46] Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem has said that the deal would destabilize the region.[47] In November 2010, Israel was reportedly offered an additional 20 F-35s in exchange for a continued freeze on Israeli settlements in the West Bank,[48] however State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley has refused to confirm these reports, and the offer was rejected.[49][50] Moshe Arens has written that Israel does not need the F-35 to maintain its technological superiority over the Arab countries and would be better off developing its own aircraft that did not have the design compromises of the F-35.[51] Gur Laish, an expert on the IAF with the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) at Tel Aviv University, wrote a report that indicated that the F-35 would have a deterrent effect with its ability to make pre-emptive attacks on hostile countries before war is declared, such as on Iran's nuclear facilities. Yiftah S. Shapir, also of the INSS at Tel Aviv University, said that the American refusal to open the fighter to full Israeli control and modification, including making the software codes available, reduces its value, but that the American relationship with Israel is so important that it rules out other alternatives such as the Sukhoi Su-57. He also noted that the earliest deliveries in 2016 would be past the date Iran was expected to have operational nuclear weapons, one of the prime reasons for having the F-35.[52] In March 2011 it was announced that Israel will pay US$144.7M per aircraft for 19 F-35As, a price that included a share of development, test and evaluation costs.[53] On 13 April, the Jerusalem Post reported that with the delivery of the F-35s appearing to be delayed until 2018, the Israelis have sought used F-15s from the United States to cover the gap.[54] While being interviewed by Haaretz in May 2011, Ehud Shani said that \"during the last visit by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to Israel a month ago, we were told that the delay may be shorter than they originally thought. In any case, I am not nervous about it. This [delay] may actually serve our interests. I favor an aircraft with as many Israeli-made systems as possible.\" He also said that \"we will see how they try to meet our requests over this time. In the original timetable, it was argued that there was no time [to incorporate Israeli systems into the Israeli F-35s]. We will hear their conclusions and I expect a dialogue with the Americans over the new timetable and the changes.\"[55] The idea that the Air Force will, in the meantime, acquire another squadron of F-15s in order to meet the gap that will be created \"is not relevant,\" he said. The delay may mean that in the future there will be more aircraft coming to Israel in a shorter period of time, and the numbers procured may rise from 20 to 30.[55] Israeli defense officials said that the problems with the F-35 were 'much worse than we had been told' and that a high-level delegation would be sent to the United States to determine the extent of the problems.[56] Israel has planned to send pilots to train in the United States in 2017 then return to Israel with the 20 jets in 2018.[57] According to a 7 July 2011 Aviation Week article, the United States has agreed to allow Israeli F-35s to be rewired so that Israeli electronic warfare systems can be installed on the aircraft. That would allow Israel to gradually add indigenous EW sensors and countermeasures on its fighters once it receives its first squadron. With that deal in hand, officials for both the IAF and Lockheed Martin expect the $2.7 billion contract for the procurement of 19 or 20 F-35As will be signed by early 2012.[58] \"I believe that Israel could receive its first F-35s in late 2016,\" said Tom Burbage, Lockheed Martin's general manager of the F-35 program. A senior IAF official, who until then was concerned about delays in the program, said that the schedule agreed upon is \"very satisfactory.\" Israel insisted that only its own EW systems would be suitable to meet the developing anti-aircraft threat in the region, such as the deployment of SA-17 and SA-22 air defense systems in Syria. But now, claimed the official, \"the F-35s we will receive will be more than ready to meet those threats.\"[58] The IAF initially presented a long list of unique and costly requirements for the JSF, but it has accepted that its first F-35s will be almost identical to those of the United States Air Force, with only Israeli command, control, computers, communications and intelligence systems installed in them. The plans to add Israeli EW systems, air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions as well as an external fuel tank, were approved in principle but were deferred in order to protect the budgetary framework and delivery schedule.[58] According to the program schedule at that time, Israeli F-35s was to be manufactured within the seventh and eighth low-rate initial production (LRIP) lot. The LRIP 5 cost was being negotiated by the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin. \"Israel could still be the first international customer to receive the JSF,\" said Burbage. One issue that remained to be settled between the two countries is when IAF crews would begin training on the F-35s and on whose platforms. Burbage said that training could commence in 2016, but it is for the Pentagon to decide which aircraft was to be made available for Israeli training.[58] Facing the possibility that the dramatic changes in the Middle East could turn peaceful neighbors Egypt and Jordan more hostile to Israel, the Israel Defense Forces aimed to build a larger, more flexible force, capable of dealing with more than the traditional northern front of Syria and Lebanon. The IAF claimed to be the only service with that flexibility, and it called for accelerating the plan to procure 75 F-35s by 2030.[58] In the following years, the Air Force was to begin decommissioning dozens of its aging fighters, such as F-16s and F-15s, and with only 20 new F-35s, its fighter fleet would reach its lowest point ever. However, there was strong competition for funding. Israeli ground commanders argued that because of the potential threat that the giant and modern Egyptian army would be turned against Israel, it is necessary to establish an additional mechanized division, equipped with Merkava tanks and the new Namer armored personnel carrier. The production of the Namer was moved to General Dynamics Land Systems in the U.S. in order to enable Israel to procure them using US military aid funding, the same funding source used to acquire the F-35s.[58] According to the Jerusalem Post, IAF officers said on 31 July 2011 that they did not anticipate that the delivery date for the F-35 would slip beyond 2017. If it did, the IAF would have needed to consider other options for that time period, such as additional F-15s to fill the gap that would be created in the event that the JSF program is further delayed.[6] On 1 August 2011, the Jerusalem Post reported that the IAF planned to purchase a second squadron of F-35s during the upcoming IDF multi-year procurement plan that was then under review by the General Staff. The second contract would have likely been of a similar number of aircraft and, depending on when the second deal was signed, the IAF could have had 40 operational aircraft by the end of the decade.[6] The Japanese government has discussed whether the export of F-35s containing Japanese products to Israel violates their laws against arms exports to countries involved in or likely to be involved in military conflicts.[59] Israeli military officials were reported to have said that the F-35 was chosen for its situational awareness capabilities.[60] The first two Israeli F-35As were to be in LRIP 8.[61] In 2013, Lockheed Martin vice president, Steve O'Bryan, said that they were \"examining the feasibility\" of adding stealthy conformal fuel tanks manufactured by Elbit Systems.[62] In October, Israel confirmed an order with the defence secretary for 25 more aircraft to equip a second squadron of F-35s.[63] However, ministerial committee member Yuval Steinitz, opposing the IDF plan, believed that order should possibly be halved due to concerns about the F-35's range, payload and maneuverability suiting Israel's needs.[64] In February, Israel signed a contract for the procurement of another 14 F-35As in a $2.82 billion deal, with a unit cost of about $110 million. An option for another 17 aircraft was included in the contract.[65] In June, the first Israeli F-35A was unveiled with Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman present.[66] The plane was to undergo further testing and actually be delivered in December. At the time it was stated that Israel had ordered 33 F-35s for delivery through 2021, with an option for 17 more.[67] In November the Prime Minister's Office announced Israel was exercising that 17 aircraft option, after a unanimous vote of the Security Cabinet in favor, taking the total number of ordered examples to 50.[68] On 12 December 2016, Israel received its first shipment of the F-35I Adir. Two Adirs landed in Israel and were received in a ceremony at Nevatim Airbase.[69][70] The arrival of the F-35I was to make Israel the first country to have an operational F-35 squadron outside of the United States, once the squadron was properly equipped.[71][72] On 23 April 2017, the Air Force received another three F-35I fighter jets.[73] In July, Israel received two more F-35s, bringing the number to 16.[74] In November, a one-of-a-kind F-35I testbed aircraft was delivered, used to test and integrate Israeli-produced weapons and electronic systems on future F-35's received. This was the only example of a testbed F-35 delivered to an air force outside of the United States.[3][4] As of May, 27 aircraft had been delivered.[75] On 26 September, 3 additional F-35s landed at Nevatim Airbase, bringing the total to 30.[8] 2022 On 24 March, 3 additional F-35Is landed in Nevatim Air Base, bringing Israel's total fleet to 33.[76] In June, F-35I had been able to conduct simulated strikes on Iran without the need for mid-air refueling.[77] On 12 November, 3 additional F-35Is landed in Israel, earmarked to join the 140 Squadron (Golden Eagle), bringing the country's total fleet to 36.[5] On 6 January, the U.S. Department of Defense restricted the use of the F-35I Adir fighter by any IAF pilots who have a foreign passport, due to information security concerns.[78] On 22 May 2018, Israel's Air force commander, Major General Amikam Norkin, reported that Israel became the first country in the world to use the F-35 in combat during recent clashes with Iran in Syria.[2] 2021 According to the IDF, on 15 March 2021 F-35Is shot down two Iranian drones, which was the first operational shoot down and interception carried out by an F-35; Ynet reported that 'defense sources' believed the drones were transporting weapons to the Gaza Strip.[79] On 15 March, Israeli F-35I fighters were scrambled to intercept and destroy two Iranian Shahed-197 drones in regional airspace,[80] scoring the first shot down for the F-35 in the world. 2023 They were also used in the Gaza war.[81][82][83] On 23 October 2023 an Israeli F-35I shot down a cruise missile launched toward Israel by the Houthis, scoring the first shoot-down of a missile by F-35 globally.[84] F-35I fighters were reportedly involved in Israeli airstrikes in Yemen in July 2024, 1,700 kilometers from Israeli territory.[85] 2025 F-35 fighters were used in the Israel-Iran War to strike Iranian targets. It was reported that they were modified with fuel tanks to increase their range.[86] The F-35 sale has been cited as one reason why there is little public pressure from Israel to stop the 2010 U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia.[87] Media related to F-35I Adir in Israeli service at Wikimedia Commons"}

The F-35 procurement has been a source of considerable controversy in public policy circles in Canada since the federal government announced its intention to purchase the aircraft in 2010. In April 2012, with the release of a highly critical Auditor General of Canada report on the failures of the government's F-35 program, the procurement was labelled a national \"scandal\" and \"fiasco\" by the media.[1][2][3][4] In a December 2014 analysis of the procurement Ottawa Citizen writer Michael Den Tandt cited the Harper government's \"ineptitude, piled upon ineptitude, and bureaucracy, and inertia, driving a lack of progress\".[5] The F-35 was conceived by the United States Department of Defense as requiring participation from many countries, either contributing to the manufacturing of the aircraft or procuring it for their own armed forces. Canada, through the Department of National Defence (DND) and the departments of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) and Industry Canada (IC), has been actively involved in the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) project since 1997. Canada's initial participation required a US$10 million investment to be an \"informed partner\" during the evaluation process. Once Lockheed Martin was selected as the JSF's primary contractor, Canada elected to become a level-three participant (along with Norway, Denmark, Turkey, and Australia) in the project. An additional US$100 million from DND over 10 years and another $50 million from IC were dedicated in 2002.[6][7] On 16 July 2010, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government announced that it intended to procure 65 F-35s to replace the existing 80 McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornets for C$9 billion (C$16 billion with all ancillary costs, such as maintenance, included) with deliveries planned for 2016.[8] Former Minister of National Defence, Peter MacKay, argued that these ancillary cost estimates were grossly exaggerated because they included the pilots salaries, and fuel for the aircraft, which were never before factored into procurement costs.[8] The stated intention was to sign a sole-sourced, untendered contract with Lockheed Martin. This, combined with the government's refusal to provide detailed costing of the procurement, became one of the major causes of the finding of contempt of Parliament and the subsequent defeat of the Conservative government through a non-confidence vote on 25 March 2011. The F-35 purchase was a major issue in the Canadian 2011 federal election, which resulted in a Conservative majority government.[9][10][11][12] On 19 October 2015, the Liberal Party of Canada under Justin Trudeau won a majority in part on a campaign promise to not buy the F-35, but instead \"one of the many, lower-priced options that better match Canada's defence needs\".[13][14] A formal competition was launched to select a new fighter, which included the F-35. On 28 March 2022, the government announced that the competition process had selected the F-35A and that negotiations would begin with Lockheed Martin to purchase 88 aircraft.[15] By 20 December 2022, the Department of National Defence received approval to spend $7 billion on 16 F-35As and related equipment, including training systems, potential weapons and support infrastructure.[16][17][18] Alan S. Williams of Queen's University, the former Assistant Deputy Minister of National Defence (Matériel) who signed the original industrial participation agreement, indicated he believes that the Government of Canada's rationale for joining the JSF project was not due to an urgent need to replace the Canadian Forces' CF-18 Hornet fleet; instead, it was driven primarily by economics.[6] Through the government's investment in the JSF, Williams said that Canadian companies were allowed to compete for contracts within the JSF project; there were fears that being shut out from industrial participation in such a large program would severely damage Canada's aviation industry.[6] Joining the JSF project also furthered Canadian Forces access to information regarding the F-35 as a possible contender when it eventually plans to replace the CF-18. Improved interoperability with major allies allowed the Canadian Forces to gain insight on leading edge practices in composites, manufacturing and logistics, and offered the ability to recoup some investment if the government did decide to purchase the F-35.[6] As a result of the Government of Canada's involvement in the JSF project, 144 contracts were awarded to Canadian companies, universities, and government facilities. Financially, the contracts are valued at US$490 million for the period 2002 to 2012, with an expected value of US$1.1 billion from current contracts in the period between 2013 and 2023, and a total potential estimated value of Canada's involvement in the JSF project from US$4.8 billion to US$6.8 billion.[6] By 2013, the potential benefits to Canadian firms had risen to $9.9 billion.[19] Canada began its investment in the F-35 program in 1997 under the Liberal government of Jean Chrétien, when the Department of National Defence (DND) committed $10M to join the \"Concept Demonstration\" phase of the Joint Strike Fighter program. In 2002 Canada invested another $150M to participate in the System Development and Demonstration phase which was scheduled for more than 10 years. In 2006 the Canadian government, along with its allies; the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Australia, Turkey, Italy and Norway[20] signed a memorandum of understanding, at an anticipated cost of over half a billion dollars to Canada, for \"Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development\" for the period 2007 to 2051.[21] The Canadian air force concluded the F-35 was the most cost effective plane to meet its needs. However, only one JSF test model existed at that time and there was no way to actually prove the JSF had the lowest cost per aircraft or that it would be the cheapest to fly.[22] Announcing a \"strong preference\" for the F-35 according to the Auditor General.[23] Canada signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the next phase of JSF development under a Conservative government, expected to cost US$551 million through 2051. Canada emphasized that the commitment does not mean Canada would purchase the plane. Canada also had to accept F-35 procurement rules, according to the auditor general, who claimed ministers were not fully informed of this aspect.[23][22] On 12 May 2008, the Canada First Defence Strategy called for replacing the CF-18 fleet, beginning in 2017.[24] The DND asked the Conservative government for permission to buy the F-35, but permission was denied.[24] The Pentagon notifies Canada that the U.S. is \"reassessing its cost projections\" because of expected delays in development, according to the auditor general.[24] Conservative Defence Minister Peter MacKay told the Commons that Canada would buy the F-35. Ninety minutes later, he said he misspoke and announced there will be an open competition with all aircraft considered. Six weeks later, ignoring what he previously said, MacKay announced that Canada will purchase 65 F-35s. The cost was estimated by the government as $9 billion. Deliveries were to begin in 2016.[22] On 16 July 2010, the government announced plans to acquire 65 F-35s, calling it the only fifth-generation design that can meet Canada's needs and ensure interoperability with NATO allies. The DND estimated a $9-billion acquisition cost.[24] Opposition parties queried the F-35's sole-sourcing.[24] The auditor general later concluded: \"in the lead-up to this announcement, required documents were prepared and key steps were taken out of sequence. Key decisions were made without required approvals or supporting documentation.\"[24] Public Works officials received a more formal statement of operational requirements from the DND as required to justify procuring the F-35 without a competition.[24] The Montreal Gazette reported in September 2010 that the Canadian Forces had planned to hold a competition in 2010, award a contract in 2012, and for the new fighter to become operational between 2018 and 2023, when the sole sourced contract was announced.[25] On 6 October 2010, retired Assistant Deputy Minister of National Defence (Matériel) Alan Williams testified before the House of Commons Defence Committee regarding the F-35, which the Canadian media had referring to as a Flying Credit Card – with no prefixed spending limit.[26][27] Williams was the ADM who signed the original industrial participation contract for the F-35 project on behalf of the government. In his testimony, Williams indicated that the lack of a competition was likely to squander billions of dollars in taxes and lost business opportunities: \"Procurement demands not only the highest degree of integrity, but also the appearance of the highest degree of integrity. Undertaking sole-source deals leaves the procurement process more vulnerable to fraud, bribery and behind the scene deal making and leaves the federal government more susceptible to such charges.\" Williams labelled Minister of National Defence Peter MacKay's logic in defending the F-35 as \"flawed ... [it] insults our intelligence\". Prime Minister Stephen Harper responded to Williams' testimony, attacking his integrity and accused him of changing his mind. Williams in turn responded to Harper: \"That's a lie ... I've never ever changed my opinion about sole-sourcing. I have no idea to what he's referring to. I take great offence to that.\"[28] On 14 October 2010, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives issued a report on the proposed F-35 buy entitled Pilot Error – Why the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter is wrong for Canada. CCPA research associate, Rideau Institute president, and co-founder of Ceasefire Canada, Steven Staples stated: \"Canada does not need the F-35, either for North American/domestic roles or for expeditionary roles. The Canadian government should not proceed ... [it] has put Lockheed Martin in an extremely strong bargaining position in future negotiations over maintenance costs.\" On government claims of Canadian aerospace jobs from the purchase, Staples wrote: \"such claims are dubious at best ... [the contract has] none of the spelled out 'offsets' that are typically built into such procurement projects.\" Staples concluded that Canada should: curtail the expeditionary role for Canadian aircraft; stretch the life of the existing CF-18s by restricting them to North American/domestic air surveillance and control; investigate the acquisition of unarmed long-endurance pilotless aircraft to undertake surveillance/reconnaissance missions and eventually air control duties; and use any savings via these measures to more effectively contribute to security.[29][30] On 26 October 2010, Sheila Fraser, Auditor General of Canada, identified \"troubling\" systemic problems, rigged competitions and cost overruns in defence procurement programs and indicated that the F-35 may cost far more than the budgeted numbers.[31] Following Fraser's report Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff stated that if elected a Liberal government would cancel the sole-sourced deal and hold a formal competition to replace the CF-18.[32] Retired Canadian Forces Lieutenant-General Angus Watt in October 2010 said of the F-35: \"It's the best of all the available choices. It provides the best value for money, the best platform to address the security needs of Canada through to 2050, which is probably how long we'll have this airplane ... The F-35 gives us a jet at the beginning of its technological life span. If you buy a jet at the end of its life span, that means in five to ten years it's going to be obsolete. That means you're going to have to try to add technology and that's really tough. The growth potential, the ability to evolve this jet over the next 30–40 years, far surpasses anything else on the market ... Stealth is not some voodoo technology ... It simply allows the pilot to survive. It isn't necessary for every mission, but for some. For instance, reconnaissance. They can go quietly into territory, undetected, and come back safely. Or they can do a mission like the Kosovo bombing campaign, where there was a fairly sophisticated air defence system, and come back completely safely.\"[33] In November 2010, representatives of both Boeing and Dassault Aviation formally complained before a Canadian parliamentary committee that, while their F/A-18 Super Hornet and Rafale fighters would satisfy all Canadian Forces requirements, they were not considered and DND officials did not even request detailed data.[34] In December 2010, Eurofighter and Saab offered their own fourth generation fighters – the Typhoon and Gripen, respectively – for less than the F-35's cost, but the Government of Canada stated that the F-35's stealth was the best way to ensure that pilots could safely complete future missions.[35] Chief of the air staff, Lieutenant-General André Deschamps, stated that stealth adds survivability for foreign missions and the element of surprise in Canada's airspace. Philippe Lagassé, a defence analyst at the University of Ottawa, disagreed that stealth benefits domestic interception.[36] On 17 November, the Standing Committee on Finance asked the parliamentary budget officer to analyze F-35 costs.[24] On 18 November, the House of Commons debated a Liberal motion to immediately cancel the F-35 process.[24] In December 2010, staff from the Canadian Forces' Directorate of Air Requirements stated that only the F-35 matched their list of 14 mandatory and 56 less absolute requirements, and claimed that the list was not devised to ensure that only the F-35 met these requirements, which were not publicly released on national security grounds.[37] A national poll conducted by Abacus Data between 29 October and 1 November 2010 indicated 35% of Canadians supported the F-35 while 37% opposed.[38] A poll conducted by EKOS Research Associates between 3–9 November 2010 showed that 54% of Canadians opposed the F-35 buy and that the largest group \"strongly oppose\" it, at 34%. The same poll showed support for the Conservative government had fallen below 30%.[39][40] By late 2010, Canada's political parties had outlined their positions on the F-35. The Conservatives had declared it their top defence priority, the Liberals indicated that they would hold a competition to select a new fighter, the New Democratic Party was opposed to the purchase and the Bloc Québécois were in favour of it only as long as Quebec aerospace firms get a share of the work.[41][42][43] In January 2011, United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that the F-35B variant would be put on two years probation due to delays and development difficulties and that the program was troubled. The announcement led to DND officials assuring that Canadian F-35 deliveries would not be delayed. Major-General Tom Lawson, the Assistant Chief of the Air Staff stated: \"without hesitation ... this is the only aircraft for the future.\" Opposition industry critic Marc Garneau responded: \"You can say that there's nothing new here that affects Canada. But all of the concerns that we've expressed in the past continue to exist. And I, from my point of view, feel that we're not out of the woods with the development of this aircraft ... We should be only looking at an aircraft that is certified, developed, and for which we have a firm cost and a delivery. And that's obviously not the case today.\" NDP national defence critic Jack Harris said: \"It indicates that the program itself has significant flaws.\"[44] The Government continued to defend the F-35, drawing parallels with the Liberal cancellation of the EH-101 helicopter in 1993. Prime Minister Stephen Harper made speeches at aerospace plants in an attempt to gain support. The Liberal party accused Harper of hypocrisy, as records indicate he was in favour of the EH-101 cancellation at the time. Liberal industry critic Marc Garneau explained his party's position on competitively selecting a new fighter: \"We know we can get a better deal for Canadians, with guaranteed offsets.\" He also questioned the utility of a short-range, single engine fighter: \"all things being equal, two engines are better than one.\"[45] General Walter Natynczyk, Chief of Defence Staff, entered the debate in January 2011 to counter a new Liberal Party advertising campaign[46] questioning the F-35. In an interview with The Globe and Mail Natynczyk stated: \"From my perspective, the F-35 is the best aircraft with the best value for Canada ... The cost per unit is the cheapest for any fourth- or fifth-generation aircraft\".[47] In January 2011, the Government enlisted the aid of two retired generals, Paul Manson and Angus Watt, to write a defence of the purchase, entitled The truth about those jets. Their position, particularly on the lack of need for a competition, was refuted by former Assistant Deputy Minister of National Defence (Materiel) Alan Williams: \"For Canada to commit to purchase an aircraft without knowing for certain what it will cost nor how it will perform operationally makes no sense. If the F-35 is, in fact, the best aircraft for Canada it will win a competition. I cannot understand why its supporters are fearful of subjecting it to an open, fair and transparent competition.\" Other observers pointed out that, while Manson had described himself as a \"former Chief of Defence Staff\" in his article, he neglected to mention his chairmanship of Lockheed Martin Canada, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. Steven Staples, President of the Rideau Institute, said: \"While this fact in no way disqualifies the generals from sharing their opinion, it is an important truth about the F-35 debate that the stealth fighters' strongest backers are the military and the aerospace companies. In fact, it's getting awfully hard to tell them apart.\" In February 2011, opposition critic Marc Garneau criticized the incurring of over C$200,000 in overtime and travel expenses for military personnel and civil servants to defend the F-35, calling the use of Canadian military staff \"unprecedented\". Liberal MP Bryon Wilfert, who reviewed DND public service overtime statistics, stated: \"The lines are being blurred between government (workers) and the Conservative Party. This is supposed to stand on its own as the best aircraft that we need, so why is it up to civil servants to sell it to the public?\"[48][49][50][51] The Government of Canada planned to purchase the F-35A, the same model as the United States Air Force (USAF). However, unlike the F-35C (for the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps), the F-35A cannot refuel from the Canadian Forces' existing tanker aircraft, which use the US Navy-style probe and drogue system. Additionally, the F-35A cannot land on the short runways of the Canadian Forces' forward operating air strips in the Arctic.[52] Defence Minister Peter MacKay stated that both issues will be dealt with.[53] Thus, Canada's F-35 were to differ from the USAF F-35A through the addition of a USN/USMC F-35B/C style refueling probe and a drag chute.[54] Harper attacked the Liberal calls for a competition, citing damages to Canada's aerospace sector: \"I don't understand how the Liberal MPs from this region could want to cancel the contract\".[22] Critics stated that, as no contract had been signed, Harper was misleading.[22] On 10 March 2011 the Parliamentary Budget Officer, Kevin Page presented a cost analysis of the F-35 program and concluding a total cost C$29.3B over 30 years, not the C$16B to C$18B claimed by the government, and a resulting per aircraft cost of C$450M each. Minister of National Defence Peter MacKay stated that cancelling the deal would \"endanger the lives of Canadian pilots\" and \"endanger the sovereignty of this country\", although he did not give specifics as to why that would be the case. In an editorial, The Globe and Mail said, \"The PBO raises sharp questions. An accountable government, one that tried to convince on the basis of evidence, would answer them.\"[55][56][57] The government questioned some of Page's assumptions, such as the 30 years lifespan instead of the planned 20. After reviewing the report, the opposition Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe was reportedly shocked by the cost and changed his mind on supporting the sole-sourced F-35 procurement and began to oppose it as unaffordable, favouring open competition instead. The DND responded with details of a $16 billion cost estimate, over a 20-year lifespan only.[58][59][60] On 23 March 2011, Page responded to the Assistant Deputy Minister of National Defence, claiming that Page made mathematical errors on both the individual F-35 cost and on long-term maintenance; Page indicated that the latest US Department of Defense estimates are for US$151M per aircraft and that the USAF would not pay more for the F-35 than its allies.[9][61] MPs reached a deadlock over a Tory attempt to strike Page's testimony.[62] Laurie Hawn, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, stated that they expected a purchase price to be between $70 and 75 million each, based on conversations with other customers.[63] He defended the 20-year budget figure and said \"It really is the best airplane for the best price with the best benefit to Canadian industry to serve our military's needs for the next 40 years\".[64] In March 2011, retired Assistant Deputy Minister of National Defence (Matériel), Alan Williams, questioned claims that the F-35 would only cost $75M per aircraft in an article entitled Let's be honest about the price tag on those planes. He stated: \"In reviewing the government material tabled on March 17, 2010 before the Parliamentary and House Affairs Committee, it appears to me that the $75-million figure is not the \"procurement cost\" but rather the \"unit recurring flyaway cost\", which is merely part of the procurement cost ... None of us can know for certain what the final cost to acquire the F-35 will be until we get a firm price quote. As production increases, the costs may drop. Nevertheless, all evidence to date indicates that we would pay over $120 million per aircraft, rather than $75 million.\"[65] Echoing Williams' statements, Mike Sullivan, Director of Acquisition Management at the US Government Accountability Office, said he doesn't know where the $75 million estimate comes from: \"That's not a number that I am familiar with at all ... [the price is] probably somewhere between $110–115 million\".[66] On 30 March 2011, the Canadian foreign policy Embassy magazine reported: \"While Lockheed says the F-35 A-variant will cost $70 to $75 million, the PBO said on Mar. 10 that this plane will likely cost between $148 and $163 million, twice the original Government of Canada estimate. The US GAO put out its annual report on the JSF program on 15 March 2011 and said there were significant per-plane cost increases as well, putting the cost of each A-variant at $127 million.\"[67] On 21 March, a parliamentary committee recommended the government be held in contempt of Parliament for failing to provide enough documents, including per-plane F-35 cost estimates.[24] Commentators suggested that the deployment of six CF-18s to Operation Odyssey Dawn was to symbolically make the case for the F-35.[68][69][70][71][72] Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Conservative Party caucus members suggested that the Libyan mission shows a need for the F-35, while others, such as Winslow Wheeler, an analyst with the Center for Defense Information in Washington, noted that the US only sent non-stealth aircraft to Libya, and stated: \"[The F-35 is the] culmination of such malevolent trends ... a poor choice ... for the United States — and for Canada\".[73][74] Lockheed had previously replied to similar points to Wheeler's, suggesting that comparisons between legacy fighters and the F-35 ought to be with added equipment equivalent to the latter's built-in capabilities.[75] Polling conducted in March 2011 by Nanos Research showed that the majority of Canadians opposed the F-35 buy, with 68% of Canadians agreeing with the statement \"now is not a good time\" to proceed. 56% of those identified as Conservatives opposed the purchase, as did 75% of undecided voters, while only 27% of those polled supported it. This poll showed increased public opposition to the F-35 over a similar poll conducted in November 2010.[76] On 22 March 2011, the Conservative government's budget presentation was poorly received by all three opposition parties. Liberal Party leader Michael Ignatieff moved a motion of non-confidence on 26 March 2011, which declared the government to be in contempt of Parliament over withheld costing data on prison construction and the F-35. All opposition parties supported the motion, triggering the 2011 federal election, in which the F-35 was a key issue.[9][10] On 28 March 2011, The Globe and Mail revealed that the Conservative Party candidate for the Ontario riding of Algoma-Manitoulin-Kapuskasing, Raymond Sturgeon, was until December 2010 a paid lobbyist working at CFN Consultants and lobbying the government on behalf of Lockheed Martin. Sturgeon stopped lobbying one month before he won the nomination. The federal government's lobbyists' registry noted that Sturgeon had worked for Lockheed Martin on: \"marketing strategy for the sale of aircraft and aircraft components to the department of national defence.\"[77][78] The riding was not won by Sturgeon, but was retained by NDP MP Carol Hughes.[79] On 28 March 2011, Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff outlined his primary objection to the F-35, noting that its huge price tag would prevent the proper funding of future health care. He reiterated that Canada needed to replace the CF-18, but that a Liberal government would hold an open competition and indicated that the government has \"absolutely got to deliver the right plane at the right price. We can't fool around here, there's only so much money to go around\" and labelled the government's position as \"deeply irresponsible\".[80] Critics of a competition pointed to the lack of rival stealth fighters to compete with the F-35 while Liberals question the need for stealth at all.[81] On 30 March 2011, Carl Meyer wrote in the Canadian foreign policy publication Embassy magazine: \"The F-35 is already promising to be a big issue in Campaign 2011 with the Liberals raising it several times ... the Conservatives are trying to contain the fallout ... that one of their candidates in the current election was a lobbyist until last December for Lockheed. Pollsters say the fighter jet tops the short list of foreign policy controversies that could end up defining the campaign if leaders begin pushing the issue as a ballot box question.\"[67] A poll conducted in the first two days of campaigning by Forum Research indicated that over 60% of Canadians oppose the F-35 buy.[82] The topic became an issue in some riding races in the election. In the Ottawa-area riding of Carleton-Mississippi Mills incumbent Conservative MP Gordon O'Connor, a retired Canadian Army general and former Minister of National Defence who was serving as the chief government whip, was challenged by retired Canadian Forces navigator Lieutenant Colonel Karen McCrimmon, running as a Liberal. McCrimmon stated that the F-35 is not suitable for Canada as it was under development, had not been evaluated for cold-weather operations, cannot safely use small northern deployment runways, is incompatible with Canada's in-flight refuelling tankers, and its single engine could not provide twin-engined reliability for use in the Arctic. O'Connor defended the F-35 as suitable as it won an intense four-year US competition: \"The aircraft is in the final stages of its development: it's a world leader.\"[83] On 5 April 2011, at a Parliament Hill press conference, Winslow Wheeler, of the Center for Defense Information in Washington said of the F-35's pricing that \"nobody on this earth\" will pay just $75M, indicating that Parliamentary Budget Officer Kevin Page's numbers were \"by far and away\" more accurate than the government estimates, and stated: \"This airplane is nothing to write home about ... a gigantic performance disappointment ... you're getting an underperforming airplane for a huge amount of money\". Wheeler recommended Canada hold a competition to choose an aircraft instead of a sole-sourced purchase.[84] On 10 April 2011, Harper stated that the US would pay more for the F-35 and Canada had a fixed price free from cost overruns: \"On the F-35s, I think we've been clear: there have been detailed briefings from the department of national defence on this, there's a memorandum of understanding that's posted. We are sheltered from research and development costs.\" On the Liberal plan to hold a competition, he said: \"This is a good deal for the country, the fantasy is on the other side. That somehow they're going to come up with some airplane out of thin air and they don't even know what airplane, they're still going to buy planes they say but they don't know airplane and they don't have any agreement.\"[85] On 17 April 2011, multiple newspapers reported that the government's C$14 billion costing does not include the F-35's engines. The engines are listed as \"government furnished equipment\", indicating they must be purchased separately. Representatives of the government and the DOD responded that the engine costs were included the overall price.[86][87][88] On 19 April 2011, retired Canadian Forces Lieutenant-General Angus Watt indicated that the engines are not included in the purchase from Lockheed Martin, but are purchased separately from Pratt & Whitney and are included in the overall price quoted. He stated that the quote of C$75M per aircraft does not include some spares, weapons or infrastructure costs and thus is not comparable to quoted US costs which do include those items; and that if included would bring unit cost to about C$138M per aircraft, comparable to current US pricing. He concluded, \"the airplane has not suddenly become more expensive. It is simply a matter of which costs you directly attribute to the airplane.\"[89][90] In April 2011, the DND issued a statement indicating that the F-35 unit price would be higher than $75M each due to development overruns. Pentagon information revealed operating costs to also be much higher than the Government of Canada had previously indicated, even higher than the Parliamentary Budget Officer had forecast and will total more than C$24B over 30 years for 65 aircraft.[91][92] Harper was dismissive of the DND statement, stating that contingency funds would cover extra costs: \"many of the reports you're citing are comparing apples to oranges. Our experts have put out their detailed figures and everything we've seen is within those figures and their contingencies — the contingencies that have been allowed.\"[92][93] Liberal Party Leader Michael Ignatieff stated: \"they say to the Canadian people we can get you the plane at the right price. Let me tell you folks. Not even President Obama knows what the planes are going to cost. This thing is out of control.\" Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe said: \"What we've said since the very beginning and when Mr. Harper is saying, he [doesn't] want to withdraw a contract, that means there's a contract. It's time until next Monday that he showed us that contract.\"[93] On 3 April 2011 the Liberal party released their policy document for the election campaign entitled Your Family. Your Future. Your Canada. Of the F-35 it stated:[94] A Liberal government will immediately cancel the mismanaged $30 billion sole-source deal for F-35 stealth fighter jets, and save billions of dollars. In the largest procurement in Canadian history, the Harper government never explained why that plane is essential at this time. It still cannot say what the actual price will be, and secured no guarantee for industrial benefits. Other countries, including the US, are scaling back orders for an aircraft still under development, but the Conservatives charged ahead, despite the facts. There is a more responsible way to proceed. After cancelling the Harper deal, a Liberal government will put further steps on hold during a review of all military procurement in light of the new international policy described in this Global Networks Strategy. This review will include Canada's search and rescue requirements as well as the needs of our air, naval and land forces. When Canada purchases new fighter planes, we will have a transparent, competitive process to procure equipment that best meets our needs, achieves best value for money, secures maximum industrial benefits, and fits a realistic budget.[94] On 4 April 2011, the Bloc Québécois released their policy document entitled Parlons Qc (English: Let's Talk Quebec). There was no mention of the F-35 or the subject of defence at all; the party had previously stated opposition to the purchase as a result of the Parliamentary Budget Officer's March 2011 report outlining the F-35's estimated costs.[60][95][96] On 7 April 2011, the Green Party of Canada released their policy document, entitled smart economy. strong communities. true democracy. The policy did not mention the F-35 by name but did state that a Green government would reorient the armed forces towards peacekeeping, and reduce military spending to the 2005 level;[97] and stated that the party would: \"Support the transition from a Department of Defence into a Department of Peace and Security\".[98] On 8 April 2011, the Conservative Party of Canada released their policy platform document entitled Stephen Harper's Low-Tax Plan For Jobs and Economic Growth. Of the F-35, it stated:[99] Support Canadian Aerospace Jobs – Stephen Harper's Government has provided strong support for jobs in Canada's world-class aerospace industry. Among other things, we have committed to purchasing the next-generation fighter jet, the F-35 – a necessary and responsible investment to re-equip Canada's air force and to strengthen Canadian sovereignty. The previous Liberal government invested in the development of the F-35, and we supported the decision, because it was and is the best option for Canada. But now Michael Ignatieff and his Coalition partners, the NDP and Bloc Québécois, have promised to scrap it – a reckless and irresponsible promise which would sacrifice $12 billion in possible economic benefits across the country, and kill thousands of Canadian jobs. A re-elected Stephen Harper Government will follow through on the purchase of the F-35, to strengthen the Canadian Armed Forces and to support thousands of jobs for Canadian aerospace workers across the country ... Strengthen the Canadian Armed Forces ... We have also committed to buying the next-generation fighter jet, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for our air force. The development of the F-35 is a cooperative program including Canada, the US, the United Kingdom, Australia, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and Turkey. The F-35 purchase is necessary to replace the current fleet of CF-18s before they are no longer useable, and to ensure Canada's fighter jets are compatible with those of our NATO allies. The investment will be made gradually over the next 15 years, most of it beginning only in 2015, once the budget is balanced. The previous Liberal government invested in the development of the F-35, and we supported the decision, because it was and is the best option for Canada. But now Michael Ignatieff and his Coalition partners, the NDP and Bloc Québécois, have promised to scrap it – a reckless and irresponsible promise which would kill thousands of well-paid, highly-skilled Canadian jobs and deny the men and women of our air force the modern equipment they need to do their job. A re-elected Stephen Harper Government will follow through on the purchase of the F-35, to ensure our air force personnel have the tools they need to defend our country in the years to come.[99] Reacting to the Conservative policy direction on the F-35, NDP leader Jack Layton stated, \"without question, Stephen Harper's high-risk procurement strategy on the fighter jets places in doubt whether he has the right priorities for Canadian Forces or that he can get the job done\" and indicated that decision will lead to \"unstable employment, lack of capital investment, high-quality, value-added jobs being shipped overseas.\" Layton indicated that the country has not had a defence white paper since 1994, and that a new white paper needed to set Canadian defence priorities before decisions on aircraft were made.[100] On 10 April 2011 the New Democratic Party released their policy platform entitled Giving your family a break – Practical first steps. On the F-35, it stated:[101] We will draft a Defence White Paper, redefining our military's role, its priorities and needs, to be completed within 12 months. During that time, all major defence projects will be reviewed; We will implement a fair and open process where competitors can offer industrial deals and benefits. Such an open process ensures Canadians get the best price, the military gets what it needs and Canadian industries get the best spin-offs; We will review the proposed F-35 purchase as part of the Defence White Paper.[101] During the English-language leaders' debate held in Ottawa on 12 April 2011, the F-35 buy was attacked by all opposition leaders and defended by Stephen Harper. In the debate Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff explained his reasoning for the election, which included the F-35: \"I think I explained why we're having an election, which is that we asked for the truth about his jets, jails and corporate tax breaks, and (Harper) didn't tell the House of Commons the truth so he was found in contempt. That's why we're having an election.\"[102] In remarks made after the debate Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe attacked the Conservative F-35 price estimates, saying, \"Well, I would imagine if you have a contract, you know how much it costs. (Harper) says he doesn't know. He refused to answer that. So we're going from $75 million for a fighter aircraft that probably doesn't even have a motor, that has no attack or defence system in it. Did we buy kites? What did we buy?\"[102] The French-language debate was held on 13 April 2011 and also prominently featured the F-35. Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff accused the Harper government of having \"forgotten people\" affected by the Late 2000s recession and indicated that the Conservatives intend to spend billions on fighters, corporate tax cuts and new super-prisons, while ignoring regional economic development. Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe attacked Harper over multiple reports that indicate Canada will pay far more for the F-35 than the government's figure of C$75M per aircraft and challenged him to reveal its actual cost.[103] Harper responded: \"I'm the only leader on this platform, on this set, who is defending the role of our Canadian and Quebec aerospace sector in the purchasing of airplanes.\"[103] Ignatieff pointed out that even the US, the country that is building the F-35, doesn't know what they will cost. Ignatieff stated, \"Even President Obama doesn't know how much it will cost the US. That's the first problem. And you have no real idea what the plane will cost you because they're still developing this plane. So we don't know how much it will cost. And as a potential prime minister I can't accept a plane, the cost of which is increasing.\"[103] Speaking in Vancouver on 17 April 2011, Ignatieff said of Harper: \"This guy has gone down to the first car lot and bought the first car he saw. And now we don't even know whether it has an engine, we're not perfectly sure it's got a steering wheel and the wheels might not be in the deal either ... The deal here that every Canadian needs to understand about the F-35 is that it is an airplane in development ... and the costs keeping going up.\" Ignatieff indicated that US officials are \"tearing their hair out at the cost overruns\" over the F-35. He further stated, \"Mr. Harper is going around trying to tell Canadians, 'I know what this plane is going to cost.' (U.S.) President (Barack) Obama doesn't know what this plane is going to cost.\" Ignatieff agreed that the CF-18 needed replacing, but said: \"but we have to get the right plane at the right price at the right time and that has to be mean a competitive bid.\"[88] On 2 May 2011, the election was held, resulting in a Conservative majority government. The New Democratic Party formed the official opposition, while the Liberal party was cut to 34 seats and the Bloc Québécois to four seats.[104] After the election further details were leaked, including more schedule delays beyond the CF-18's retirement.[105] In late 2011, it was revealed that the F-35 would not be able to communicate via the Canadian Forces satellite communications network used in the Canadian Arctic. This deficiency is expected to be addressed in the fourth production phase in 2019, or perhaps later. The RCAF was considering whether a stop-gap solution, such as an external communications pod could be fitted to the F-35.[106] On 15 June 2011, Assistant Deputy Minister for National Defence (Materiel) Dan Ross mistakenly testified to Parliament that the F-35A's development had already been completed.[107] In November 2011, The Canadian Press released several access-to-information request responses on the procurement. DND documents indicate that 65 aircraft represent the absolute minimum number; this did not include any attrition aircraft. An Air Force Association of Canada source said that this was done to minimize the total purchase price. The reports also noted that delivery plans indicate that the F-35s would be delivered at the same time that the CF-18s are to retire, leaving no room for delays.[108] Chief of Defence Staff General Walter Natynczyk confirmed on 3 November 2011 in addressing the House of Commons Standing Committee on National Defence that 65 is the \"bare minimum number\" needed.[109] Government officials confirmed that delays had been accounted for. Retired Canadian Forces Lieutenant-General George MacDonald, who has worked as a consultant at Lockheed Martin, said: \"this delay eats most of that up. So the risk is still not great for Canada. But it's tighter. The schedule doesn't have the flexibility it used to have.\"[110] In November, it was announced that initial F-35s deliveries will lack communication systems such as Link 16 or Blue Force Tracking, which allows them to communicate with older aircraft and ground forces, helping to reduce friendly fire incidents. These functions aren't expected until an upgrade program in 2019.[111][112] In November, Associate Defence Minister Julian Fantino outlined the government's F-35 plan: \"We will purchase the F-35 ... We're part of the crusade. We're not backing down.\" Roughly one week later, he stated: \"There's a plan A, there's a plan B, there's a plan C, there's a plan Z and they're all F-35s.\"[22] On 13 March 2012, Fantino told the Commons Defence Committee that the government had not ruled out backing away from the F-35.[24] In response to F-35A sales to the USAF and the Royal Air Force at a unit price of US$141–145M each, Fantino said in an interview with L'Actualite that: \"We are still talking about it ... Could it be fewer than 65? Maybe.\" On 3 November 2011, Chief of Defence Staff General Walter Natynczyk stated to the House of Commons Standing Committee on National Defence, \"Sixty-five is the minimal operational requirement for us. We need to have these aircraft, both for the sovereignty of Canada and to meet our international obligations.\" Fantino refused to elaborate on the interview when asked in the Commons on 12 December 2011; the opposition said Fantino's remarks showed that the government's insistence on a lower price of US$75M per aircraft was wrong. The NDP military procurement critic Matthew Kellway stated: \"It's an acknowledgment that they can't get the plane for the number that they said they could. I think just about everybody else in the world has acknowledged that that's the case.\"[113][114] In December 2011, Defence Research and Development Canada predicted a 54% chance of losing aircraft to the point of having only 63 in service at the time last one is delivered.[115] By February 2012, mounting delays and increasing costs resulted in the government reconsidering how many aircraft can be affordably bought. The US government's latest budget documents included buying 29 F-35s in fiscal year 2013 for US$9.17B[116][117] On 9 February 2012, Associate Minister of Defence Julian Fantino called a journal article, written by Dr. Michael Byers of the University of British Columbia and by the Salt Spring Forum's Research Associate, Stewart Webb, on the F-35 purchase: \"critical of everything that is holy and decent about the government's efforts\".[116][118] Byers and Webb responded to Fantino via Embassy magazine, stating: \"Thanks to the introduction of faith-based procurement, the Harper government can now ignore the complexities and inefficiencies of design specifications, equipment testing, contract tendering, specified industrial regional benefits, etc. From now on, decisions on new equipment for the Canadian Forces will be divinely ordained, and channelled to Canadians through Mr. Fantino's divine connections ... it occurred to us that cows, and other things, are sometimes referred to as holy. Especially by people, like Mr. Fantino, who are prone to missteps.\"[119] In an interview with Evan Solomon on CBC's Power & Politics on 13 February 2012, Fantino explained: \"I think Canada ... has to be very much plugged in to the environment, the economics of the day if you will, but we remain committed to ensuring that we purchase or we acquire the best resources for our men and women, and also at the very same time address the absolute certainty that Canada, Canadian taxpayers will receive the best possible outcome.\" Fantino confirmed that Canada will host a meeting at the Canadian embassy in Washington in March 2012 where the F-35 partner nations can \"deal with misinformation, miscommunication and a whole lot of other misunderstandings with respect to this aircraft.\"[116][120] NDP MP Peter Julian pronounced the F-35 a \"fiasco ... $30-billion boondoggle ... They botched this file from the beginning to the end and they need to come clean with Canadian taxpayers.\" NDP MP Brian Masse, indicated that the government's assertion that the purchase is on track is a \"fantasy.\" Interim Liberal Leader Bob Rae said: \"the deal is now a different deal than the one that we thought we originally had so clearly there's a problem. This is a government that is targeting Old Age Security because they say that's unsustainable. But when it comes to a jet contract whose ultimate price we do not know, how many planes we do not know, its affordability we do not know, they say, 'Oh that, that is sacrosanct. So clearly they've made their priorities.\"[116] The news media and editorial writers provided analysis and comment on the government's use of rote speeches and obscuring jargon on the issue. Toronto Star national affairs columnist Tim Harper indicated a \"Plan B\" to the F-35 was inevitable: \"the price tag Ottawa has placed on the planes —$16 billion — was surely conjured by Aesop and its insistence on delivery dates had to be penned by the Brothers Grimm. The bargain bulk buying price that was quoted because the plane would be in \"peak production\" starting in 2016 is gone. The US estimate is almost double the cost per plane. There were ever only two guarantees associated with this untendered deal — cost overruns and production delays. There should now be a third guarantee. This government will drastically reduce the size of this deal — why 65? — or seek to extend the life of the CF-18s or both ... They may stick it in the federal budget in the name of austerity, or they may release the decision under cover of Friday evening darkness.\"[121] The National Post's John Ivison reported on 14 February 2012 that the Harper cabinet had discussed cutting the F-35 buy and ordering armed UAVs instead, although the military dismissed drone replacements. Ivison indicated that a likely outcome of an aerospace industry review by former industry minister David Emerson is the purchase of a combination of Boeing F-18E Super Hornets and UAVs, terming the F-35 \"a political millstone\".[122] On 15 February 2012, Fantino dismissed reports of UAVs covering a shortfall in F-35s as \"speculation\" and refused to state how many F-35s Canada would buy, what the cost would be or when they would be delivered. Liberal Leader Bob Rae responded: \"The prime minister said that the government is going to live within its $9.5 billion budget. (Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Walter) Natyncyzk said they need at least 65 planes, and that is a minimum number. Now Lockheed has said that the price is going to be far higher than the original $75 million. These are three things that just do not go together.\"[123] A meeting of F-35 partners was held at the Canadian Embassy in Washington on 1–2 March 2012, hosted by Canadian Associate Minister of Defence Julian Fantino. Fantino described the meeting as confirming that the F-35 is progressing and that all partners remain committed to its procurement: \"While good progress continues to be made, we will always be vigilant with our stewardship of taxpayers' hard earned dollars.\"[124] By mid March, the government's tone about the F-35 buy shifted. On 13 March 2012, Fantino stated before the House of Commons Defence Committee, \"We have not as yet discounted ... backing out of any of the program ... One of the things that I know for certain is that Canada remains involved in the joint strike fighter program ... The decision, the determinate decision, has not as yet been made as to whether or not we are going to actually purchase, buy, acquire, the F-35.\" Fantino confirmed that senior defence department officials is examining alternatives to the F-35. The CBC's Laura Payton wrote, \"Fantino's comments mark a change in tone from previous answers to questions about the possibility of rising costs and design problems with the Lockheed Martin fighter jets. He had previously left no possibility the government is exploring other options or considering pulling out of the agreement with allies like the United States, Norway, Italy and Australia.\"[125][126][127] Interim Liberal Leader Bob Rae responded to the government's statements: \"Inevitably, they'll have to find a new model, because the F-35 model doesn't work for Canada. What obviously happened in Washington was that Lockheed Martin made it crystal clear that this is not a $75-million buy. And even though the prime minister said months ago that Canada had a firm, firm contract at $75 million, what Mr. Fantino is saying today is completely different: There is no contract, it's not a matter of when but if and when.\"[125] NDP defence critic David Christopherson stated that Fantino's remarks illustrated that the Conservative government previous dismissal of criticism as unpatriotic has been \"all bluster and the reason they suggest it's maybe unpatriotic is because they don't have solid answers to give. They're in serious trouble here. This program is not working, it's not flying. Literally, it's not flying.\"[127] The Globe and Mail columnist Campbell Clark accused Fantino of carrying out a \"classic tactical manoeuvre: the quarter-turn retreat ... the Harper government is committed to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, but not so much that it's necessarily going to buy the things. Mr. Fantino's definition of commitment would make a marriage counsellor blush.\"[128] On 15 March 2012, media reports were released about an upcoming Auditor General of Canada report that concludes that the DND misled Parliament about the costs of the F-35. National Post columnist John Ivison noted the Department's long history of intentionally underestimating costs in order to get desired equipment and predicted the report will contribute to the cancellation of the F-35 acquisition. Ivison stated, \"the fall-out in Parliament may persuade the government the price of sticking with the F-35 program is no longer worth paying\". Indications are that the Auditor General's highly critical report was behind the governments' sudden change in stance on the F-35. Senior government officials had warned the Harper government to leave room to exit the program, but were ignored as the F-35 became a central feature of the 2011 election campaign.[129][130] Liberal defence critic John McKay stated, \"It does speak to the issue of the military's ability to snowball politicians ... this is a government that basically snookered themselves by wrapping themselves in the military's flag so they can no longer critique the military.\" Retired Defence Assistant Deputy Minister Matériel Alan Williams said, \"this is the first case that I can recall of a clear and unambiguous hijacking of the process.\"[131] The news of the upcoming Auditor General's report led to media prediction that the procurement would be frozen, although aerospace and defence industry experts expected the deal will be cancelled in favour of an open competition.[132] On 26 March 2012, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program Power & Politics host Evan Solomon reported that he had seen the unpublished original operational requirements statement for the new fighter, and that the F-35 failed to meet one requirement. Questions were also asked about the statement of operational requirements, how it was written only weeks ahead of the defence minister's public announcement of the F-35 purchase. Former assistant deputy defence minister Alan Williams stated that proper procedures were not followed: \"not only is it not normal, but it's a complete hijacking and rigging of the process. In 2006, the military and civilians recommended the F-35 to the minister and four years later, they developed their requirements, obviously rigged or wired to ensure that the only jet to meet the requirements would be the one that they recommended four years earlier.\"[133] The requirement in question seemed to be written to require the promised Helmet mounted display and AN/AAQ-37 electro-optical Distributed Aperture System (DAS) of the F-35, which are now failing to perform to this spec.[134] The new NDP leader Thomas Mulcair said the documents reported by the CBC indicated that the government created a \"bogus bidding process\" to hide that it had already chosen the F-35 before the requirements had even been written. Mulcair stated, \"They tried to rig the process by defining something that only one plane could meet. It's a very old strategy in government procurement, but even there we're now finding out the F-35 doesn't meet the bogus requirements that they were setting out in their rigged bid. They're bringing us down a corridor that can only result in one thing, the purchase of that one [plane] because their next argument is going to be 15 years later we can't start changing our mind.\"[135] Documents obtained by the Ottawa Citizen showed that DND officials met more with Lockheed Martin representatives than all other competitors combined and the meetings with competitors were \"pro-forma\" to simply show that they had met. University of Calgary Director of the Centre for Military and Strategic Studies, David Bercuson, stated \"there never really was a competition\".[136] The rigging accusation was taken up by opposition MPs in the Commons on 27 March 2012. NDP MP Matthew Kellway indicated that the government had tabled a response to an order paper stating that F-35 currently met all of the military's stated requirements. Kellway asked, \"Which document is the truth? The one for public consumption or the one kept secret?\". Fantino's answer was \"We will remain committed to the Joint Strike Fighter program ... a contract has not been signed for a replacement aircraft and we will make sure that the air force and the men and women there have the necessary tools to do their job and that's the bottom line.\"[135] Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated that \"we haven't yet signed a contract, as you know, we retain that flexibility but we are committed to continuing our aerospace sector's participation in the development of the F-35.\"[135] On 28 March 2012, Harper gave assurances that even if the government decides not to buy any F-35s, Canada would remain an F-35 industrial participant to guarantee that work would continue to come to Canadian companies. By March 2012, 66 Canadian companies had won C$435M in F-35 contracts against a federal government investment of C$278M.[137] Interim Liberal Leader Bob Rae said that the government appeared to be considering alternatives to the F-35 and this should be made public: \"There's obviously been a shift in position in the last several weeks.\"[135] On 3 April 2012, the Auditor General of Canada heavily criticized the F-35 procurement in his spring report, which stated that the government did not run a fair competition, that costs were seriously understated and that decisions were made without required approvals or documentation. The report said, \"when National Defence decided to recommend the acquisition of the F-35, it was too involved with the aircraft and the JSF Program to run a fair competition. It applied the rules for standard procurement projects but prepared key documents and took key steps out of proper sequence. As a result, the process was inefficient and not managed well. Key decisions were made without required approvals or supporting documentation ... National Defence did not exercise the diligence that would be expected in managing a $25-billion commitment. It is important that a purchase of this size be managed rigorously and transparently.\"[138][139][140][141] As a result of the report, the government announced it would strip the DND of responsibility for the project and give it to a new special secretariat of deputy ministers that will be part of the Public Works and Government Services Canada. The Treasury Board will also be involved and will review all DND documents to improve accuracy and oversight. Associate Defence Minister Julian Fantino confirmed that the government will also study alternatives to the F-35. Treasury Board will commission an independent review, including all assumptions made, along with potential costs. The review will be made public when complete. Furthermore, Rona Ambrose, the minister responsible for Public Works and Government Services Canada, stated \"Funding will remain frozen and Canada will not purchase new aircraft until further due diligence, oversight and transparency is applied to the process of replacing the Canadian Forces' aging CF-18 fleet\".[138] The opposition responded quickly to the Auditor General's report. Marc Garneau, the Liberal Party's Industry, Science, and Technology critic, said \"The government will do an enormous amount of spin today and say that they were misled by [Defence Department] officials, it wasn't their fault, and now they're going to take action. There is no question that the generals ... wanted the F-35 and drove everything towards that. But that doesn't excuse the minister of national defence and the prime minister for buying it, hook, line and sinker, without then doing their own due diligence.\"[138] Interim Liberal leader Bob Rae argued that Harper was responsible: \"Any company that made a mistake of this kind, that misled its shareholders, that misled the public, that put out a misleading prospectus, that published false figures and false documents to the tune of billions of dollars, any company that did those things would fire the CEO and replace the board of directors.\" Rae indicated that Liberal Party research showed trouble in 2010: \"The numbers did not add up. The numbers were not real numbers ... [Harper] called us liars. He said we were unpatriotic. He cannot now pretend that he was just the piano player in the brothel who didn't have a clue as to what was really going on upstairs.\" Rae called on Harper to resign for deliberately misleading Parliament and lying to Canadians and concluded: \"Stephen Harper is not fit to be the Prime Minister of Canada\".[142][143] Matthew Kellway, NDP military procurement critic said \"They still have a lot of explaining to do for the auditor general's report and we will keep asking them for explanations for, for example, the $10 billion that suddenly was left out of the department's estimates for the F-35. All I can say is that it's hard to [say], in light of all the information in the media, all the information coming out of various accountability offices in the United States, that they weren't aware. But I think we're left with basically a binary alternative here. Either they were aware and they deliberately misled Canadians or they weren't aware and we have a negligence and competence issue with this government.\"[142] Conservative MP Chris Alexander, parliamentary secretary to Defence Minister Peter MacKay, blamed the media for the scandal: \"In the media, there has been a consistent effort to mislead people, to imply that money has been spent. It hasn't yet.\"[142] The media also reacted, referring to the \"F-35 scandal\" and \"the F-35 fiasco\".[1][2] Ottawa Citizen columnist Michael Den Tandt wrote: \"Here's what a sober-minded, fiscally responsible and cautious prime minister would do, given the outrageous chronicle of incompetence, stupidity and duplicity revealed by Auditor General Michael Ferguson's report on the F-35 fighter program: He would demand and receive the resignation of Chief of the Defence Staff Walter Natynczyk. He would demand and receive the resignation of Defence Minister Peter MacKay.\"[144] CBC News reporter Brian Stewart stated that the events indicate infighting between DND and the government, dominated by a culture of secrecy and intimidation.[145] The Globe and Mail's John Ibbitson indicated that the Harper government had \"bungled the biggest and most important contract on its watch\". He added that for a \"Prime Minister who practically branded criticism of the F-35 acquisition as treasonous must now deeply regret, and will have to eat, his words.\"[146] Andrew Coyne of the National Post said \"a fiasco from top to bottom, combining lapses of professional ethics, ministerial responsibility and democratic accountability into one spectacular illustration of how completely our system of government has gone to hell\".[2] On 5 April 2012, Auditor General Michael Ferguson stated before the House of Commons Defence Committee that, based on his investigation, that the government would have known that the F-35 cost estimate was C$25B at the time that the DND told Parliament it was C$14.7B, weeks prior to the May 2011 federal election, but not say whether he believed the government intentionally misled Parliament. Harper and other ministers refused to answer any opposition questions regarding when they knew that the DND had estimated the program cost would be C$25 billion.[147][148] Interim Liberal leader Bob Rae responded to this revelation: \"if they did, then we have a real problem because then that means that they were effectively misleading Parliament for many, many, many months. Misleading the people of Canada throughout the last election.\" Rae also raised a question of privilege in the Commons over the government's statement that they accept the Auditor General's recommendations, but not his conclusions, asserting that if the government accepts Ferguson's report, then it accepts the fact that it misled Parliament. Government House leader Peter Van Loan disagreed with Rae's position: \"the position of the government is not the position taken by the officials in those departments.\"[147][148] NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair, in a speech to the Economic Club of Canada, said: \"we have clear and convincing evidence that the government intentionally provided false information to Parliament and that's serious. This is a basic question of respect of our institutions.\"[147] NDP military procurement critic Matthew Kellway said: \"what's just been uncovered and revealed is political fraud at the core of this government ... This is a matter of knowing the cost estimates and failing to tell Canadians what those cost estimates were and, in fact, approving information going out that was knowingly false.\"[148] DND officials indicated that failures lie with the Defence Minister Peter MacKay and Associate Minister Julian Fantino, that both had given contradictory messages about competitions, costs, and made claims that did not hold up under scrutiny.[139] Press reaction to the Auditor General's statements was swift. Michael Den Tandt of the Ottawa Citizen wrote that if the Auditor General's report is \"true then [Harper's government] will have no defenders, anywhere ... The government itself will be discredited. There is no moving on from a lie this big.\" CBC political commentator Rex Murphy called Defence Minister Peter MacKay \"a seat warmer with status\" and indicated he must resign. Peter Wothington, writing in the Toronto Sun said \"the monkey business over Canada committing (sort of) to the hugely expensive F-35s without competitive bids as 'the only acceptable plane,' stinks to high heaven. If it's the 'only acceptable plane,' what's to fear from competitive bids?\"[149][150][151][152] On 8 April, on the CTV program Question Period Defence Minister Peter MacKay indicated that the change in public figures of C$10B was \"a different interpretation in the all-up costs\" and refused to resign. MacKay also warned that, while Canada could stop the purchase without losing any money at this point, cancelling the existing memorandum of understanding would mean losing Canada's place on the production run and thus delaying the CF-18's replacement. NDP MP Jack Harris said \"They can't paper this over. This is going to haunt them\". Liberal MP Ralph Goodale agreed with Harris stating, \"There's no way Mr. MacKay can explain this away. And quite frankly this buck doesn't stop with Mr. MacKay ... It is the prime minister who knew every minute detail of this file.\" In arguing that operating costs should not be included MacKay cited the Auditor General's report that he stated showed that Parliamentary Budget Officer Kevin Page had also left the F-35's operating costs out. MacKay was mistaken and actually cited the DND's own accounting in the Auditor General's report by mistake and not Page's. The DND had actually removed the operating costs for its lower estimate, while Page included them in his own $14-billion number. Liberal Defence critic Marc Garneau labelled MacKay incompetent: \"It's very disturbing ... I had to go to the question of, 'is he trying to pull a quick one on us again, hoping the general public is not going to see this?' Or is he not too bright? It went through my mind, I have to admit.\"[153][154][155][156][157] On 9 April 2012, Chief of Defence Staff General Walter Natynczyk endorsed the F-35 purchase during a ceremony at Vimy Ridge and claimed that he was always honest on the F-35's costs. Winslow Wheeler, of the Centre for Defence Information indicated that the money issue is just a small part of the story and that the press has been ignoring that the aircraft will not perform the missions asked of it and focused on its lack of stealth capabilities, inability to defend itself and inability to fill the fighter role. Retired Assistant Deputy Minister of National Defence (Matériel) Alan Williams raised the issue that the departmental cost estimates were set at 20 years instead of the planned lifespan of 36 years, thus reducing the costs for replacement aircraft and mid-life upgrades. Williams said \"That's a known distortion. If you have as your intent to be as open as possible, you don't do that.[158][159] Williams also accused the government of secretly intending to buy 79 F-35s instead of the planned 65 and splitting the purchase to hide the costs.[160][161] On 10 April 2012, an editorial in the Ottawa Citizen agreed that the costing can plausibly be made to include or exclude a myriad of factors, but concluded \"the government must still explain its benefits to Canadians. What jobs will it create in Canada? What are the risks that the price of the F-35 will be more than Canada can afford? What is our plan if that happens? All these points must be addressed with factual analysis, not assertions. The F-35 controversy proves, not for the first time, that full and honest disclosure is preferable to editing the facts down to what government thinks people need to know. The downside of managing the truth is that, when you finally tell it, people just won't believe you.\"[162] On 14 April 2012, opposition members of the House of Commons public accounts committee commenced action to recall the committee to examine the Auditor General's report. The government indicated that it welcomed a public review. On 18 April 2012, the Conservatives used their majority on the committee to prevent the calling of critical witnesses, resulting in opposition accusations of a cover-up. Liberal MP Gerry Byrne said, \"This exposes that they have no intentions of actually operating in a transparent and accountable way. They'll hold meetings in secret. They won't allow officials to appear before us. They will do everything to prevent the truth from being heard.\" NDP MP Malcolm Allen said, \"this is about trying to control the message. Which members of the executive of this government knew what and when? From my perspective, we're not headed down a good road. What would be more humiliating and more embarrassing to them is the testimony from the witnesses that I proposed. They will do anything and everything to cover this up.\"[163][164] Defence Minister MacKay claimed that the Auditor General and the DND merely disagreed on what to include in the F-35's life cycle costs. The National Post's Andrew Coyne pointed out that DND had agreed with the Auditor General in 2010, after a similar dispute on the Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone, that all life cycle costs be included in future reports: \"once that claim is knocked down — that this was all just a dispute over accounting — there is no escape. The government knowingly misrepresented the true costs of the F-35 ... It knew how it was supposed to account for these, under Treasury Board rules, under the Auditor-General's recommendation, and by its own publicly stated agreement with both ... It simply chose to tell a different story to Parliament and the public ... This isn't about the planes, in other words, or costs, or accounting. This is about accountability. This is about whether departments are answerable to their ministers, and whether ministers are answerable to Parliament — or whether billions of public dollars can be appropriated without the informed consent of either Parliament or the public ... And it is about whether we, as citizens, are prepared to pay attention, and hold people in power to account when they lie to us. Which is to say, it is about whether we live in a functioning Parliamentary democracy, or want to.\"[165] On 25 April 2012, retired air force Colonel Paul Maillet, an aeronautical engineer and former CF-18 fleet manager at National Defence Headquarters spoke out against the F-35, indicating it was unsuitable for Canadian service: \"How do you get a single-engine, low-range, low-payload, low-manoeuvrability aircraft that is being optimized for close air support ... to operate effectively in the North?\" He also noted that it will obsolete soon due to UAV technology advances and suggested that the F-18E/F Super Hornet, or CF-18 life extensions, and buying UAVs would be a better choice. Jay Paxton, spokesman for Defence Minister Peter MacKay, dismissed Maillet's comments: \"the goal of this failed candidate is to promote a political party without a care for the future of our nation.\"[166][167] On 26 April 2012, an access to information request revealed that Deputy Defence Minister Robert Fonberg had briefed Fantino about the F-35's cost and schedule problems at the same time that Fantino was publicly saying that these items were not issues.[168] On 28 April 2012, Parliamentary Budget Officer Kevin Page was interviewed on the CBC Radio program The House and indicated that the government appeared to have two sets of books on the F-35 project, one for internal use with higher estimates and one for public consumption with lower numbers. Page also indicated that due to soaring prices, the government would only afford 40–45 F-35, not the minimum 65 required. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) stated that each F-35 cost US$137M in 2012.[169] In May 2012, the newly created interdepartmental secretariat charged with overseeing the fighter acquisition indicated that the DND should, on its own volition start from scratch with a complete assessment of alternatives. An unnamed senior official said, \"If the military were smart, they would do it themselves, unsolicited. There seems to be an overwhelming public appetite to ask why [the government is] asking for this capability, and to be involved in a consideration of whether we should continue.\"[170] On 2 May 2012, the Public Works Minister, Rona Ambrose confirmed that the name of the secretariat had been changed to eliminate the impression of bias in the selection, changing from \"F-35 Secretariat\" to \"National Fighter Procurement Secretariat\".[171] In May 2012, former Assistant Deputy Minister of Defence Alan Williams released a book, entitled Canada, Democracy and The F-35, which explained how the process was run backwards, picking the aircraft first and then creating requirements to justify the choice. Williams also accused the government of repeated lies on the F-35, contending that routine government statements were false, including that \"there was a competition in 2001, so there is no need to conduct another one. Canada needs the F-35 because of the industrial and regional benefits. The government was just continuing along the lines established by the previous Liberal government. The F-35 is the best aircraft at the best price. The F-35 will cost the U.S. $75 million.\"[172] On 14 May 2012, an annual planning report for the F-35 program was presented to the House of Commons by Treasury Board President Tony Clement which clearly indicated that the government was still not considering any alternatives and expected delivery of the first example in 2017, a year later than previously forecast. This was despite the fact that both the Defence Minister and Associate Defence Minister had asserted that no decision to procure it had been made.[173] On 15 May 2012, in response to confusing and contradictory information provided by officials at the DND in response to parliamentary committee hearings into the F-35 affair, opposition parliamentary committee members declared that they had lost confidence in the department. NDP MP Malcolm Allen stated. \"There's no faith in this department anymore. None whatsoever ... This is a department that's really gone rogue. [Defence Minister Peter MacKay] has totally lost control of that department. If the officials in the Defence Department are actually misleading the committee and misleading Parliament then I guess they ought to be gone. You can't have folks at that level misleading the committee and misleading Parliament ...\"[174] On 24 May 2012, Lockheed Martin issued a statement that if Canada does not buy the F-35 then Canadian companies will not get future contracts. Lockheed Martin Vice President Steve O'Bryan said, \"right now we will honour all existing contracts that we have. After that, all F-35 work will be directed into countries that are buying the airplane.\" O'Bryan also indicated that Canada was buying the F-35, despite the government indicating that the purchase was being reconsidered: \"What we have is the official statement out of the government and we're working with the government. They're committed to the F-35, they've selected it, and we haven't had any change in that official position\".[175] On 17 May 2012, the Conservative majority in the public accounts committee, led by Conservative MP Andrew Saxton, moved to stop calling witnesses and have the panel prepare its report on the auditor general's findings of the F-35 procurement. Committee member Liberal MP Gerry Byrne, said: \"The government wants to shut this down, and for good reason. They are very afraid of what is going to come out.\" Byrne faced possible punishment from the committee for relating an in camera meeting, which parliamentary rules prohibit.[176][177] In June 2012, emails were released, showing that the DND knew in 2011 that the F-35 deliveries would not be completed until after the CF-18 was required to be retired, contradicting the Conservative government's assertions that a stop gap measure would not be needed. Life extensions for the CF-18 fleet had been previously rejected as too expensive.[178] Also associate defence minister Julian Fantino revealed that the mandatory requirements for the replacement aircraft included \"stealth, secure data link communications, visual operation in no-light conditions and automatic data and sensors information sharing\", all areas in which the F-35 is supposed to excel in.[179] In August 2012, a tender for an independent auditor had not been filled, reportedly due to the tender not permitting sub-contracting. An amended tender was re-issued on 8 August 2012; Amber Irwin, a spokeswoman for Public Works Minister Rona Ambrose, explained, \"This request for proposals (RFP) issued today will ensure that this independent review is done properly and supersedes the previous one issued. The requirements of the RFP have been broadened to ensure qualified bidders can fulfil the task required by the government ... The National Fighter Procurement Secretariat is committed to getting this done right and in a timely manner.\"[180] New Democratic Party procurement critic Matthew Kellway labelled the delays as \"absurd\", and said, \"this is a process that is out of control. The government has gone to great lengths and jumped over a lot of hurdles, likely at tremendous cost to Canadians, to avoid releasing numbers that are being produced by the Joint Strike Fighter Program office.\"[180] As the government blocked opposition members of the House Defence Committee to call certain witnesses via termination of debate, members of the NDP decided to hold separate hearings on Parliament Hill on 21 August 2012. NDP defence critic Jack Harris explained: \"we will be referring to the testimony that was given here today. We will [sic] using that to reinforce the arguments that this government is not doing the right thing\". The meeting heard from retired US defence auditor Winslow Wheeler, former Canadian Associate Deputy Minister of Defence Alan Williams, University of Ottawa defence procurement expert Philippe Lagasse and defence writer Scott Taylor; all four were critical of the procurement process and the F-35 selection. Wheeler stated \"The F-35 is only 25 per cent through its flight test program ... [it] won't be finished until 2019. Anybody, including my country, who buys this airplane before then, is a fool because you don't know what you're getting in terms of performance. And you don't know what you're getting in terms of cost.\"[181] In August, Steve O'Bryan, Lockheed Martin Vice-President, stated that the firm planned to deliver 65 F-35s to Canada. The parliamentary secretary to Minister of National Defence Peter MacKay, Chris Alexander, stated that the government had never announced it would buy the F-35 and accused opposition parties of starting rumours to cause confusion; despite repeated announcements by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, MacKay and other senior officials stating the purchase in 2010. Philippe Lagasse, a defence expert at the University of Ottawa, explained: \"Governments do this all the time, and it's totally understandable that they would try to change the conversation. The problem is there's so much public evidence, that really you're inviting mockery.\"[182][183] In September 2012, KPMG was selected to audit the independent cost review of Canada's F-35 acquisition at a cost of C$643,535.[184][185] Also that month the National Defence revealed that its CF-18 pilots have been shutting down one of the two engines almost once a month for the past twenty years, raising additional questions about the safe operations of a single engine fighter.[186] On 28 September 2012, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired an investigative report on The Fifth Estate that provided evidence that the DND failed to seriously consider alternatives and had taken US evaluations of competitors at face value. The former Canadian chief of the air staff, Lieutenant-General Steve Lucas, commented that there had not been a competition, as it conflicted with Canada's participation in the F-35 program. Ottawa defence analyst Steven Staples also indicated that the 2010 announcement of Canada's F-35 purchase was intended to give Lockheed Martin good news amid development troubles. Former Pentagon aircraft designer Pierre Sprey expressed the expectation that unit prices would continue to rise and reach in excess of US$200M.[187] The Public Works and Government Services Canada issued a RFP for a firm to review the purchase decision on 26 October 2012. The chosen company will receive a contract in December 2012 to review factors under the existing seven-point action plan. The contractor will \"determine whether the shortcomings the Auditor General identified in the acquisition process have been addressed; confirm whether the steps taken in the acquisition process for the period up to June 2012 were in accordance with government policies, procedures and regulations; and provide lessons learned and propose recommendations for changes, if any, to current practices and policies for acquisitions of a similar nature\".[188] Despite the apparent copying of the F-35 in the Chinese Shenyang J-31, NDP MP Matthew Kellway said that since Canada would never oppose China, there was no need for Canada to have advanced fighters.[189] On 21 November 2012, the public accounts committee presented its final F-35 report. The report cited the DND for poor procurement handling, without further explanation or blame; and called for future transparency and accountability. Opposition politicians called the report, crafted by a Conservative-majority committee, a whitewash. NDP MP Malcolm Allen said, \"When you compare the final [committee] report to the auditor general's report, it's nothing but one great big whitewash. We were hoping to see that Canadians would really find out the whole truth of what actually transpired and this government would then take responsibility for its actions on this file.\" The Canadian Press found that the most pointed comments of Page and Ferguson were deleted or softened in the final report.[190][191] The National Post noted, \"There have been allegations the Harper government remains committed to buying the F-35 despite its insistence that other possible replacements for the country's CF-18 fighters are being considered. Those concerns were bolstered over the weekend when Defence Minister Peter MacKay refused to say whether the government is actually looking at other options.\"[192] In late November, it was decided to put aside the statement of requirements to conduct an options analysis, including dialogue with nations purchasing the F-35.[193] General Thomas J. Lawson, Canada's Chief of the Defence Staff, has admitted the partial stealth features offered by competing \"4.5th generation\" fighters would also be sufficient to meet Canada's needs.[194] In December 2012, it was revealed that Prime Minister Harper and the cabinet had been kept up to date on the F-35's various problems, delays, and cost overruns, even as Harper had been painting a rosy picture leading up to the election.[195] On 6 December, the Ottawa Citizen ran a front page headline, Federal government cancels F-35 fighter purchase, and indicated that the pending KPMG report had placed program costs at $44.8B, that the Cabinet operations committee had decided to cancel the purchase and hold a competition.[22] The Prime Minister's Office responded, saying that the F-35 buy was not cancelled and calling the story \"inaccurate\". The National Post reported that the KPMG report put the full program cost at $45,802,000,000 over 42 years, double the amount previously publicized by the government, and that the US government was alarmed by media claims of cancellation. Another factor noted in news sources and in questions from parliament was the lack of guaranteed purchases of Canadian products as part of the deal, unlike most military aircraft deals. Canada will incur costs whether it stays in the F-35 program or not as the government will be required to invest more in May 2013 or else attract penalties if it withdraws from industrial participation.[196][197][198][199][200] The Ottawa Citizen also reported that the KPMG report's timing was critical with regard to the 2012 US elections: \"The PM (Stephen Harper) didn't want it to become a (U.S.) election issue and therefore hurt Canada-U.S. relations.\"[201] Interim Liberal Leader Bob Rae called for the Defence Minister MacKay's resignation: \"I don't see how the minister of defence can possibly continue in his job ... He's basically been a sales spokesperson for Lockheed Martin ... He's denigrated and attacked every person in opposition, in the Liberal Party or elsewhere, who has ever raised concerns or questions about this ... The government has consistently misled Canadians about the true cost of this aircraft ... about their degree of oversight and their readiness to deal with the situation\". Liberal defence critic John McKay also called for the Defence Minister to resign: \"He's already been half fired by the prime minister. He's not responsible for procurement any longer.\" A spokesman for the Prime Minister responded to such calls: \"Not going to happen\".[198][200] NDP defence critic Jack Harris stated \"The whole process is in a shambles ... We've got enough misleading information out there ... They didn't do their due diligence, they didn't have an open, fair and transparent process. They've demonstrated their incompetence in a $40-billion-plus contract.\"[198] Postmedia News's Andrew Coyne said: \"It is difficult to imagine how a worse mess could have been made of the F-35 procurement ... culpable incompetence, mixed with deliberate misrepresentation. What started with a catastrophic failure of oversight, progressed through many months of dishonesty, secrecy, and stonewalling, culminating in what can only be called electoral fraud — followed by still more dishonesty about everything that had gone before.\"[202] The government appointed an independent panel to consider the topic of a new fighter for Canada over a period of three months. The panel consisted of: Philippe Lagassé, assistant professor of public and international affairs at the University of Ottawa and critic of the F-35 procurement; James Mitchell of consulting firm Sussex Circle, a retired senior civil servant with cabinet and the Treasury Board; Keith Coulter, former head of the Communications Security Establishment, former fighter pilot who commanded a CF-18 squadron and former member of the Snowbirds; Rod Monette, former federal comptroller-general and DND chartered accountant. The government also quietly informed aerospace industry principals that they should expect a full competition to follow the analysis of options.[201][203][204] The government released the KPMG report on 12 December 2012, which projected a lifetime cost at C$45.8 billion over 42 years and showed that the estimated cost to both purchase and provide needed upgrades and infrastructure was included the government's $9 billion figure given previously, although it did not include operating costs.[205][206][207] Also, in order to keep the purchase under $9 billion, the new estimate eliminated the requirement to be compatible with Canadian refueling aircraft and expenditures on infrastructure and ammunition were reduced.[208] The industrial offsets report, also released on 12 December 2012, showed that the best estimate of potential benefits to Canadian industry would be C$9.8 billion, far below the C$45.8 billion the government was forecast to spend. The report also said that the government would be expected to pay $92M per aircraft, not the $75M that Harper had said was guaranteed.[207] Public Works Minister Rona Ambrose stated the government's acceptance of the Auditor General's report. Defence Minister Peter MacKay said the program had been \"reset\". Officials confirmed that sole sourced F-35 buy was off the table and that all fighters in, or close to, production would be considered for the CF-18 replacement. The Eurofighter Typhoon and the Super Hornet were specifically named, while the Dassault Rafale and Saab Gripen may also be considered. Other manufacturers indicated they will not provide data to Canada without a full competition. Officials also confirmed that CF-18 life extensions were under analysis. NDP MP Jack Harris responded: \"This is a charade ... They're not going to put it out to a fair and transparent public tendering process\".[207][209][210][211] Defence Minister Peter MacKay was asked if he regretted his previous harsh language used against critics who turned out to be right in their assessments, MacKay described himself as being \"passionate\" regarding military procurement priorities.[210] The Ottawa Citizen published an editorial by Andrew Coyne on 12 December 2012 entitled Tories refuse, even now, to come clean on F-35 costs, detailing how the government continued to try to reduce the damaging effects of the costs KPMG revealed. Coyne said, \"just to be clear, they're still spinning us ... even with the release of its own specially commissioned independent review by the accounting firm of KPMG, the Conservative government still can't bring itself to tell us the whole truth about the costs of the F-35 ... even if one were inclined to excuse the initial deception, what is really inexcusable is the government's subsequent refusal to back down ... as it did after the Parliamentary Budget Officer's report, as it did after the auditor general's report, as it is doing even today.\"[212] In a scathing editorial published by CBC News on 13 December 2012, Brian Stewart termed the F-35 a \"global wrecking ball\" due to its lack of affordability. He faulted the decision to manufacture the aircraft before flight testing was completed for driving up costs and indicated that the huge cost, including a per aircraft cost of US$167M, would have \"strategic consequences\" as nations cancel or cut back orders, thus driving up unit costs further. Stewart stated, \"America's problems here put Ottawa in a most uncomfortable position as it finds itself wrestling with a fighter option it can't afford with an aerospace giant in decline and likely unable to extend as many economic side benefits as were initially promised ... But given the enormous stakes involved, we can expect immense pressure from the U.S., our closest ally, to not reject this plane before the eyes of the world.\" He concluded that the F-35 acquisition is a \"dank swamp [that] will only grow more terrifying for ministers to contemplate with each passing month\".[213] On 13 December 2012, interim Liberal leader Bob Rae stated: \"I think Canadians need to understand how big a screw-up this has been ... I think this is a huge spin operation. One of the things that came out yesterday is the government said the life of the CF-18s is longer than previously thought ... We haven't had a question period for the last six months where [Defence Minister] Peter MacKay has answered a single question about the affair.\"[214] Former National Defence procurement chief Alan Williams said that the government's focus on stealth is misplaced and what is really needed is an assessment of Canada's actual needs.[215] Opposition critics and inside sources accused the government of refusing a competition and suggested the requirements may be manipulated to only qualify the F-35.[216] Experts debated what the \"reset\" of the process would accomplish. Rob Huebert, from the Centre for Military and Strategic Studies, University of Calgary, indicated that the F-35 would be chosen anyway: \"what's the alternative? ... You're not going to buy the Russian or Chinese aircraft — that just ties you in to a back lane that you just don't want to go into.\" Huebert said that the Eurofighter Typhoon is solely an \"interceptor\", the Saab Gripen is \"a bit of a [Cold War] relic\", and the Super Hornet a \"total colossal waste of money\", noted that Australia bought them only as a stopgap measure before the F-35 arrives. Ugarhan Berkok from the Royal Military College of Canada disagreed with Huebert, saying that \"multi-function is probably the order of the day\"; he indicated that the Typhoon, Rafale, Gripen and Super Hornet all have that capability. Ottawa Citizen columnist Michael Den Tandt called for a cabinet shuffle to remove MacKay as Defence Minister and \"a reset of the government itself\".[214][217] A poll conducted by Forum Research in January 2013 found that, while two thirds believed that Harper had misled them, almost half thought the F-35 deal would proceed anyway. NDP MP Matthew Kellway said of the poll: \"I think the vast majority of Canadians have seen enough to understand that misleading Canadians is pathological for this government. They suggest that flipping through brochures of other fighter jets—again—is a serious reset of the procurement process. That is arrogant and cynical, it assumes Canadians are gullible and these numbers [in this poll] show that that is clearly a miscalculation.\"[218] On 21 January 2013, having left his government position, retired Assistant Deputy Minister (Materiel) Dan Ross criticised Harper's culture of secrecy and lack of accountability. On the outcome of the new procurement process, Ross predicted: \"At the end of the day, the Royal Canadian Air Force will fly F-35s, if we have an Air Force that flies fighters.\"[219] On 25 January 2013, the Canadian National Fighter Procurement Secretariat issued a draft questionnaire to Boeing, Dassault Aviation, EADS, Lockheed Martin, and Saab Group to obtain detailed information on the capabilities of their available fighters. The draft questionnaire seeks detailed information on technical capabilities of fighters in, or close to, production.[220] Public Works indicated that these other fighters might only be used as a stop gap solution until the F-35 was ready.[221] Each of the four companies received the same 15 page survey asking for suggestions, but not detailed pricing information.[222] Critics and one of the manufacturers of an alternative fighter called the Public Works activity a market analysis of the fighters that did not probe deeply into Canada's actual needs.[223] In February 2013, retired Air Force Colonel Paul Maillet, who had previously worked on fighter procurement, reacted to an announcement of a reduction in the budget for weapons in the F-35 program estimates. He noted that since the aircraft will still require bombs and missiles, these would be moved into other funding projects, a violation of normal cost accounting procedures. Maillet suggested that if adequate stocks of weapons were not purchased, then the F-35 would be relegated to a surveillance role.[224] In February, Boeing launched a campaign to convince Canada to buy the Boeing Super Hornet instead of the F-35, promoting it on the basis that the overall cost of ownership would be half that of the F-35, even though the Super Hornet has two engines.[225] The Conservative government opened the door for plans to extend the useful lives of the existing CF-18 fleet.[226] By March, observers were noting that the F-35 buy had become an object of national ridicule. Due to its lack of IFR capability and inability to be operated in cold weather as well as issues with helmet design, cockpit design, radar and other factors, Maclean's columnist Aaron Wherry referred to it as \"a joke\" and compared it to the Senate of Canada for ineffectiveness. NDP defence critic Matthew Kellway said in the House of Commons, \"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives committed to buying the F-35 multiple times. They told us it is on the right track multiple times. According to the Pentagon, the F-35 needs a heated hangar in Florida, it cannot fly at night, and the pilots stay out of the clouds.\"[227] In April 2013, Lockheed Martin announced that the per unit price had risen and was now expected to be US$85M per aircraft. The company also commenced a Canada-wide promotional effort, including a travelling simulator, to convince Canadians that the F-35 should still be purchased. Unusually, the advertising campaign including purchasing large ads on OC Transpo buses in Ottawa.[228][229] In May 2013, Saab declined to participate in the Canadian government's market analysis for alternatives to the F-35.[230] On 3 June 2013, Saab unexpectedly pulled the JAS 39 Gripen from the competition. Following talks with Canada, Saab decided not to take part as \"conditions were not ripe to act\", but it may re-enter if conditions changed.[231] In June 2013, e-mails surfaced that indicated that Canadian diplomats and military personnel had been instructed to downplay the negative impacts of the Auditor General's report a year earlier. They were told to inform allied nations that the criticism of the Auditor General's F-35 purchase was only \"bureaucratic\" in nature and not a substantive issue, as part of federal government damage-control efforts.[232] With a decision on the fighter contract delayed until after the next Canadian national election,[233] an over $200 million investment in a new software center that would employ up to 20 Canadian military officials was also on hold.[234] In August, an independent audit by the accounting firm of Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton forecast a Canadian unit price of $95.2M per aircraft in 2017.[235] By September 2013, the estimated potential lifetime costs of the fleet had grown to $71 billion.[236] Also in September, Lockheed Martin announced that if Canada does not decide to buy the F-35 then Canadian industry would lose $10.5 billion in potential future F-35-related aerospace contracts. Company Executive Vice-President Orlando Carvalho indicated that Lockheed Martin will honour existing contracts with Canadian firms but that future contracts would go to companies in nations that do buy the F-35.[237] In September 2013, Boeing provided Canada with cost and capability data for its Advanced F/A-18 Super Hornet, suggesting that a fleet of 65 aircraft would cost $1.7 billion less than a fleet of F-35s. The Advanced Super Hornet builds upon the existing Super Hornet, which is derived from the F/A-18 Hornet and an improvement over the current, modernized CF-18 Hornet. The U.S. Navy buys Super Hornets for $52 million per aircraft, while the advanced version would add $6–$10 million per aircraft, depending on options selected.[238] William D. Hartung, the Director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy and the author of Prophets of War: Lockheed Martin and the Making of the Military-Industrial Complex warned Canadians about Lockheed Martin's motives: \"Lockheed Martin may make bold promises of Canadian job creation with products like the F-35, but the fact remains, their priority will be keeping their main customer – the U.S. Department of Defense – happy by providing American jobs – even if they are supported by Canadian weapons purchases.\" Hartung suggested Canada should supported the Arms Trade Treaty which was voted favourably, but not adopted by Canada: \"the government would be well advised to aim at controlling the arms industry, rather than investing in defence firms\".[239] Dassault Aviation of France launched a marketing campaign to sell Canada the twin-engined, combat proven Dassault Rafale instead of the F-35. Dassault offered to transfer intellectual property and technology, including source codes, and also contractually guarantee industrial offsets in the same amount as the aircraft's contract value.[240] In April, the \"options analysis\" of the different fighters available was completed, although the report itself was not made public.[241] An analysis by The Globe and Mail found that, even if a full competition were held, it would \"automatically lead to F-35\", as the Statement of Requirements (SoR) was written to require its capabilities.[242] Some political observers called the report's commissioning a delaying tactic to keep the F-35 issue out of the next federal election.[243] That month, the first F-35 delivery was delayed again to 2018.[244][245] In late April, a report for The Centre for Policy Alternatives and the Rideau Institute by Michael Byers, indicated that government estimates for the F-35 program may underestimate cost by Cdn$12-Cdn$81 billion, depending on different factors taken over the aircraft's 40-year lifespan. Lockheed Martin's vice president of F-35 business development and customer engagement, Steven O'Bryan, indicated that he thought the data used was out of date and suggested that reports like this were intentionally trying to inflate the F-35's price tag.[246] The Ottawa Citizen discovered that pre-publication versions of the December 2012 DND report had questioned the F-35's ability to fulfill Canada's needs, but that these had been removed from the final report which focused only on price.[247] In June, the government's independent panel on the new fighter released their report; this examined the risks and costs of each possible fighter choice, but did not make a recommendation as to which to buy, leaving that up to the government to decide. Panel member James Mitchell stated: \"The purpose of this is not (to) reach conclusions or recommendations but to satisfy ministers that the necessary rigorous analytic work has been done ... fairly and objectively.\" Alan Williams, the DND's former head of procurement and formerly headed Canada's initial involvement in the F-35 program, dismissed the report as a public relations ploy and argued that an open competition is required.[248] In June, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives released a report entitled \"One Dead Pilot,\" written by Michael Byers, the Canada Research Chair in Global Politics and International Law at the University of British Columbia; it noted that for Canadian operations \"the need for a twin-engine fighter jet is very clear ... a single-engine fighter jet would be a serious mistake.\"[249] In August, Industry Canada released a report that showed that 32 Canadian companies had received US$587M in contracts for work on the F-35 program, an increase of US$83M since 2013.[250] The Conservative government approved an upgrade to the CF-18 fleet to keep them flying until 2025.[22] Secret defence documents indicated that delay in procuring a new fighter would lead to costly CF-18 life extension work. Analysis indicated that indecision would push back F-35 costs and keep it from being an issue in the upcoming federal election.[251] In a 27 October briefing to the secretary of the USAF by Lt.-Gen. Chris Bogdan, the F-35 program head at the Pentagon, revealed that Canada will buy four F-35s by swapping their LRIP 9 purchase for four USAF jets in the LRIP 6 batch, formalizing the order in November 2014 and taking delivery in 2015. The government repeatedly denied that a secret purchase had been arranged. NDP defence critic Jack Harris stated it was \"outrageous ... going on behind the backs of Canadians after the debacle that we've had with the F-35, keeping everybody in the dark about the price, sole sourcing it after they said they were going to have an open competition ... taking action without the kind of transparency that's required, without the proper debate, without notifying Canadians, without notifying Parliament.\" Liberal defence critic Joyce Murray asked, \"Why is an American general informing us that Canada is set to order four F-35s in the next few weeks? ... Pressing the 'reset' button on the CF-18 replacement clearly hasn't taught the Conservatives a single thing about conducting an open and transparent procurement process.\"[252][253][254][255] Unnamed government sources claimed that Lockheed Martin had not provided even basic data for such a decision while development issues and unknown costs rule out a quick buy.[256] By December 2014, a global oil price collapse had reduced the Canadian dollar's value. That factor, plus inflation and increased F-35 costs, resulted in a DND report indicating that the needed 65 F-35s could no longer be bought within the planned budget when contingencies were accounted for.[257] That month, an DND report stated: \"it is estimated that seven to 11 aircraft could be lost over the useful life of the fleet and the cost to replace these lost aircraft could be in the order of $1 billion.\" This cost had not been accounted for before.[258] Another DND report on future fighter operational requirements stated that Canada was \"highly unlikely\" to engage in first strikes against other nations with sophisticated air defences and there was little operational need for stealth aircraft.[259] On 10 December 2014, Ottawa Citizen writer Michael Den Tandt criticized Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the F-35 procurement: \"He promised the country a renewed, properly equipped, capable military, lo those many years ago, in 2005–06. Old planes are not new planes. And no amount of shifting blame, or dodging or weaving, can obscure that this was simply bungled, almost beyond repair. It is ineptitude, piled upon ineptitude, and bureaucracy, and inertia, driving a lack of progress. These are not, we are told, what the Harper government is supposed to be about. These are not great feats to be defended at election time.[5] In September 2015, Michael Byers, Canada Research Chair in Global Politics and International Law at the University of British Columbia wrote an analysis of the F-35 procurement that indicated with the recent loss of value of the Canadian dollar, due to a crash in oil prices, that it was no longer affordable. Byers' calculations indicated that the RCAF could only afford to buy 54 F-35s, well below the minimum number of 65 needed to fill the role. Byers indicated the only options were to increase the funds available to buy the minimum number or else buy a more affordable aircraft. He also noted that increasing the money available was unlikely and noted that the Harper government had cut defence spending to the lowest levels in 50 years. Byers concluded, \"the fact is, Harper took a reckless approach to replacing the CF-18s. He could have held a fair competition at the outset, and bought a proven model of fighter jet on-time and on-budget. Instead, he reached for the latest and most expensive technology, took on a significant cost risk, and got burned.\"[260] With a federal election campaign underway, both the main opposition parties indicated they would hold a competition to replace the CF-18. On 21 September, Liberal Party of Canada leader Justin Trudeau promised an \"open and transparent competition\" to choose a more affordable aircraft than the F-35. Trudeau stated that money saved by not buying the F-35 would be employed to buy ships for the Royal Canadian Navy.[260][261][262] On 21 September 2015, Prime Minister Stephen Harper responded to Trudeau ruling out the F-35 as too expensive: \"The Liberal Party is living in a dream world if they think we can pull out of the development project of the F-35 and not lose business ... Whether it's his statements on the aerospace industry, his statements on the deficit, you name it. It shows his disconnect and a profound lack of understanding about the Canadian economy.\"[263] The same day NDP leader Tom Mulcair stated that Trudeau's ruling out the F-35 showed his \"total lack of experience ... how can he decide the result in advance of the process? You can't do that.\" Mulcair indicated that the NDP would hold an open competition to replace the CF-18, that would include the F-35 as a contender.[263] On 21 September 2015, Trudeau spoke about the F-35 at a Orleans, Ontario election rally: \"That F-35 might be Stephen Harper's dream, but I can tell you, for Canadian taxpayers, it'll be a nightmare.\" Writer Mark Gollom of CBC News noted that Trudeau used the F-35 issue to differentiate himself from the Conservative and NDP positions and \"seemed to relish [Harper's response], wearing the insult almost as a badge of honour\".[264] A Canadian Press analysis of the claim that cancelling the F-35 would negatively affect the Canadian aerospace sector noted that F-35 contracts make up 2.29% of the industry's total revenues and would probably be offset with work on any new fighter chosen. Murray Brewster of The Canadian Press concluded: \"Harper's claim earns the rating of \"a lot of baloney.\"\"[265] The Green Party of Canada stated in their 21 September 2015 election platform: \"we will not purchase the F-35 stealth fighter jets. We will invest in new military equipment that fits Canada's defence requirements. We will purchase fixed-wing search and rescue planes, ice-breakers and replace dangerous old military hardware to ensure that threats to our military are not posed by the equipment we give them.\"[266] The Liberal Party of Canada released their 5 October 2015 election platform: \"We will not buy the F-35 stealth fighter-bomber. We will immediately launch an open and transparent competition to replace the CF-18 fighter aircraft. The primary mission of our fighter aircraft should remain the defence of North America, not stealth first-strike capability. We will reduce the procurement budget for replacing the CF-18s, and will instead purchase one of the many, lower-priced options that better match Canada's defence needs ... We will make investing in the Royal Canadian Navy a top priority. By purchasing more affordable alternatives to the F-35s, we will be able to invest in strengthening our Navy.\"[14] The New Democratic Party of Canada released their election platform on 9 October 2015: \"The attempt to sole-source the F-35 fighter jet while hiding the full costs was just one of several major procurement failures on the Conservatives' watch ... [we will] launch a comprehensive review, as part of the Defence White Paper, to determine how best to meet Canada's needs in the replacement of our aging fleet of CF-18 Fighters, and ensure that any new program is subject to a competitive process.\"[267] The Conservative Party of Canada also released their election platform on 9 October 2015. It made no mention of the F-35 or fighter procurement at all.[268] On 19 October 2015, the Liberal Party of Canada under Justin Trudeau won a large majority, after having made the election promise not to buy the F-35, but instead to hold an open competition excluding the F-35, to pick a more suitable aircraft.[13][14] By October 2015, the Government of Canada had spent US$309.3M on the program, including US$10.6M on the concept demonstration phase, US$94.4M to the system development and demonstration phase and US$204.3M for the production, sustainment, and follow-on development phase. In 2014, a government report indicated that just over 30 Canadian firms had active contracts worth US$637M.[269] In November 2015, the Hill Times reported that the previous government had quietly disbanded the Public Works department secretariat established in 2012 that was in charge of reviewing the fighter procurement earlier in 2015, indicating that a decision had been made on the purchase. The cabinet had apparently not approved the procurement of the F-35.[270] Harjit Sajjan, the new Liberal Defence Minister refused to say that the F-35 would be excluded from a competition to replace the CF-18, as had been promised in the Liberal campaign document. Sajjan said, \"my focus isn't about F-35 or any other aircraft; my focus is about replacing the CF-18s. We will open it up to an open process.\"[271] In an interview in February 2016, Judy Foote, Minister of Public Services and Procurement, did not rule out including the F-35 in the competition to replace the CF-18. She indicated that Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan had not completed his review of the new fighter aircraft requirements. Foote said, \"We need to look at what is required of the defence position we take as a country and we can do that by looking at any number of options.\"[272] In March 2016, Robert Work, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, indicated that it was important for the Government of Canada to take its time and make the right decision on a fighter aircraft for its needs. He said, \"It's important for Canada to make the decision on the aircraft that they need for their national interest, and then the United States and Canada can work it out ... These are very important political decisions and defence decisions for Canada to make, and we're not trying to pressure them in any way.\"[273] Conservative MP James Bezan warned that if Canada does not buy the F-35 that existing contracts with Canadian firms would be cancelled. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan disagreed, saying \"I don't think those jobs are going to be cancelled. These Canadian companies have been selected for a particular reason because of their skills.\" Lockheed Martin had previously stated that existing contracts with Canadian companies would not be cancelled, but that new contracts may not be awarded if Canada does not choose the F-35.[274] On 31 May 2016, the government missed a $32M payment to remain part of the F-35 consortium. A spokesperson for the defence department stated, \"the missed payment does not signal Canada's withdrawal from the agreement\".[275] In June 2016, the media reported multiple sources indicated that the new Liberal government had decided to buy Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets as an \"interim\" fighter, after Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan warned that the country has an impending military capability gap. The F-18E/Fs would be retained until some future date after a competition is held. This approach may reduce the chances of lawsuits over the campaign promise not to buy the F-35.[276] In response to the rumours about an interim fighter purchase, Lockheed Martin made statements that indicated that Canadian aerospace manufacturers would lose contracts to build F-35 components if the government buys an aircraft other than the F-35.[277] Alan Williams, who had previously criticized the Harper government for proposing to sole-source, said, \"I was shocked, I don't think anyone would have expected that kind of behaviour ... I'm not sure companies want to take the government to court on this kind of thing, but, you know, there is no legal justification for doing this.\"[275] On 6 June 2016, a spokeswoman for the Defence Minister stated that no sole-sourced deal had been discussed.[275] On 10 June 2016, Pat Finn, the Assistant Defence Deputy Minister of Materiel, addressed a House of Commons committee and stated that all the possible options, including sole-sourcing and a full competition, were under study, but that no decision had been made.[277] On 22 November 2016, Sajjan announced that the country would acquire 18 Super Hornets as an interim measure to make up for the CF-18's waning capabilities. Sajjan noted that continuing to fly the CF-18s past their lifespan \"would be imprudent and irresponsible\".[278] Minister of Public Services and Procurement Judy Foote indicated that a full competition would be held for a new fighter and that process would likely take five years, given a full defence policy review that is underway and must be completed first.[278] Alan Williams, the DND's former head of procurement, responded to the Super Hornet announcement, saying it was \"absurd ... I'm not sure whether the government really understands the business of defence procurement\".[279] Lockheed Martin responded to the news: \"although disappointed with this decision, we remain confident the F-35 is the best solution to meet Canada's operational requirements at the most affordable price, and the F-35 has proven in all competitions to be lower in cost than fourth-generation competitors\".[278] In November 2016, the government contributed a further C$36M to the F-35 development program, to maintain the country's status as a program participant, including access to F-35 contract work for Canadian companies.[280] The Liberal government decided not to buy an interim fleet of Super Hornets after Boeing launched a trade action against Canada over subsidies paid to Bombardier for its CSeries airliners. Instead, Canada bought 18 used Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18s, delivered in January 2019, to keep its fleet of similar aircraft flying until a full competition can be held. The competition was to see a contract award in 2019 and first deliveries in 2025. Reports claimed that no company was excluded from the competition process, but were assessed on their \"overall impact on Canada's economic interests\", a move believed to penalize companies like Boeing for taking legal action against the country.[281] In July 2019, the federal government released a formal request for proposals to purchase 88 new fighters. The request invited Airbus, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Saab to submit proposals for their Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-35 and the Saab Gripen, in a competition that will assess the bids under a points system, assigning 60% for technical merit, 20% for cost and 20% for industrial benefits to Canada. The winner is expected to be announced in 2022 and first deliveries in 2025.[282] Dassault announced it would not place a bid for the competition in November 2018, citing cost and development issues with properly integrating the aircraft to the NORAD and Five Eyes requirements as being too high, as well as the high cost of integrating American weapon systems. Similarly, Airbus withdrew the Eurofighter Typhoon from the competition in August 2019, citing the same reasons as Dassault, leaving only the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-35 and the Gripen E as potential contenders.[283] In January 2021 Saab stated that if the Gripen E won the competition that it could be produced, assembled and maintained in Canada. The company also indicated that the Gripen would also meet all Canada's obligations under NORAD.[284] In November 2021, Boeing was informed that the Super Hornet bid did not meet Canada's requirements, leaving the F-35A Lightning II and the Saab 39 Gripen E as the two remaining candidates in the competition.[285] On 28 March 2022, the Government of Canada announced that the competition had placed the F-35A first and planned to buy 88 of them. Under procurement rules, the government would then enter into negotiations with Lockheed Martin for the purchase and if an acceptable agreement was not reached then negotiations for the second place Saab Gripen would begin.[15][286][287] On 9 January 2023, the Government of Canada announced that a deal had been signed to buy 88 F-35s. The first deliveries are expected in 2026, and the first squadron will be operational in 2029, with the full fleet operational between 2032 and 2034. The agreement stated these will be Lot 18, Block 4 aircraft, the most recent version as of November 2022. The price remained the same as previously announced in 2022, $19 billion, purchased in lots, with the cost of first four aircraft at $85 million each.[288][289] On 14 March 2025, Defence Minister Bill Blair announced that Canada was looking at potential alternatives to the F-35 due to American tariffs and threats of annexation.[290] The payment for the first 16 aircraft has already been paid and Minister Blair suggested that the first F-35s could be accepted, with the remainder of the fleet being made up by aircraft from European suppliers.[291] In March 2025 the Canadian government ordered a review of the F-35 purchase in order to examine other options beyond the already paid for 16 airframes. It has been widely speculated that the Saab JAS 39 Gripen would be the likely alternative. The review was to be completed by September 21, 2025, but as of October 10, 2025, has yet to be released."}

As of 2025,[update] these are the most advanced fighters in operation. The characteristics of a fifth-generation fighter are not universally agreed upon, and not every fifth-generation type necessarily has them all; however, they typically include stealth, low-probability-of-intercept radar (LPIR), agile airframes with supercruise performance, advanced avionics features, and highly integrated computer systems capable of networking with other elements within the battlespace for situational awareness and C3 (command, control and communications) capabilities.[1] As of December 2025,[update] the combat-ready fifth-generation fighters are the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, which entered service with the United States Air Force (USAF) in December 2005; the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, which entered service with the United States Marine Corps (USMC) in July 2015;[2][3] the Chengdu J-20 and Shenyang J-35A, which are both in service with the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) beginning in March 2017 and September 2025 respectively;[4][5] Shenyang J-35, which entered service with People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) in September 2025;[5] and the Sukhoi Su-57, which entered service with the Russian Air Force (VVS) on 25 December 2020.[6] Other national and international projects are in various stages of development. The emerging generation of advanced fighter aircraft in the first decades of the 21st century has come to be known as the fifth generation.[7] The defining characteristics of such a fifth-generation fighter are not universally agreed upon, and not every fifth-generation type necessarily has them all. Some generation counts include more than five leading up to the emerging new generation.[8][9] Whereas previous fourth-generation fighters emphasized maneuverability and close-range dogfighting, typical fifth-generation characteristics include:[9][1] In order to minimize their radar cross-section (RCS), most fifth-generation fighters use chines instead of standard leading edge extensions and lack canards, though the Sukhoi T-50 has engine intake extensions that seem to function somewhat like canards, and the Chengdu J-20 designers have chosen the agility enhancements of canards in spite of their poor stealth characteristics.[10] They all have twin canted vertical tails (similar to a V-tail) also to minimize side RCS. Most fifth-generation fighters with supermaneuverability achieve it through thrust vectoring. They all have internal weapon bays in order to avoid high RCS weapon pylons, but they all have external hardpoints on their wings for use on non-stealthy missions, such as the external fuel tanks the F-22 carries when deploying to a new theater. All fifth-generation fighters have a high percentage of composite materials, in order to reduce RCS and weight. All revealed fifth-generation fighters use commercial off-the-shelf main processors to directly control all sensors to form a consolidated view of the battlespace with both onboard and networked sensors, while previous-generation jet fighters used federated systems where each sensor or pod would present its own readings for the pilot to combine in their own mind a view of the battlespace.[11][12][13] The F-22A was physically delivered without synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or situation awareness infra-red search and track. It will gain SAR later through software upgrades.[14] However, any flaw in these complex software systems can disable supposedly unrelated aircraft systems, and the complexity of a software-defined aircraft can lead to a software crisis with additional costs and delays.[15][16] By the end of 2013, the biggest concern with the F-35 program was software, especially the software required for data fusion across the many sensors.[17] Sukhoi calls their expert system for sensor fusion the artificial intelligence of the Su-57.[18] Flight tests of their integrated modular avionics started in 2017 on a fiber optic networked multicore processor system.[19] The system is not without faults. In December 2020, a malfunction with the computer flight control system caused the first production Su-57 to crash.[20] An automatic software response to an overheat condition apparently has contributed to a crash of an F-22.[21] Issues with the avionics also contributed to an F-35A crash in 2020.[22] The F-35 uses software-defined radio systems, in which common middleware controls field-programmable gate arrays.[14] Col. Arthur Tomassetti has said that the F-35 is a \"software intensive airplane and software is easy to upgrade, as opposed to hardware\".[23] In order to ease the addition of new software features, the F-35 has adopted a kernel and application separation of security responsibilities.[24] Steve O'Bryan of Lockheed Martin has said that the F-35 may gain the ability to operate UAVs through a future software upgrade.[25] The USN is already planning to place its Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike system under the control of a manned aircraft, to act as a flying missile magazine.[26] The combination of stealthy airframes, stealthy sensors, and stealthy communications is designed to allow fifth-generation fighters to engage other aircraft before those targets are aware of their presence.[27] Lt. Col. Gene McFalls of the USAF has said that sensor fusion will feed into inventory databases to precisely identify aircraft at a distance.[28] Sensor fusion and automatic target tracking are projected to give the fifth-generation jet fighter pilot a view of the battlespace superior to that of legacy AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) aircraft that may be forced back from the front lines by increasing threats. Therefore, tactical control could be shifted forwards to the pilots in the fighters.[29] Michael Wynne, former Secretary of the United States Air Force, has suggested elimination of the Boeing E-3 Sentry and Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS in favor of more F-35s, simply because so much effort is being made by the Russians and Chinese to target these platforms that are built to commercial airliner standards.[30] However, the more powerful sensors, such as AESA radar which is able to operate in multiple modes at the same time, may present too much information for the single pilot in the F-22, F-35 and Su-57 to adequately use. The Sukhoi/HAL FGFA offered a return to the two-seat configuration common in fourth generation strike fighters, but this was rejected over cost concerns.[31] There is ongoing research to apply track-before-detect across sensor fusion in the core CPU to allow fifth-generation fighters to engage targets that no single sensor has by itself detected.[32] Probability theory is used to determine \"what data to believe, when to believe and how much to believe\".[33] These sensors produce too much data for the onboard computers to fully process so sensor fusion is achieved by comparing what is observed against preloaded threat libraries that contain known enemy capabilities for a given region.[34] Items that do not match known threats are not even displayed.[35] Gilmary M. Hostage III has suggested that fifth-generation jet fighters will operate together in a \"combat cloud\" along with future unmanned combat aircraft,[36] and Michael Manazir has suggested that this might come as quickly as loading a UCLASS with AMRAAMs to be launched at the command of an F-35.[37] Prototypes and concept demonstrators built by American manufacturers included the Lockheed YF-22 – 1990 (2 built), Northrop YF-23 – 1990 (2 built) for the Advanced Tactical Fighter program, Boeing Bird of Prey – 1996 (1 built), McDonnell Douglas X-36 – 1997 (2 scale models built), the Lockheed Martin X-35 – 2000 (2 built) and Boeing X-32 – 2001 (2 built) for the Joint Strike Fighter program. Previous-generation radar low observable (LO) aircraft, also referred to as stealth aircraft, such as the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber and Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk ground attack aircraft were not designed for air to air combat, lacking the active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars, low probability of intercept (LPI) data networks, aerial performance, and air-to-air weapons necessary to engage other aircraft.[38] In the early 1970s, various American design projects identified stealth, speed, and maneuverability as key characteristics of a next-generation air-to-air combat aircraft. This led to the Request for Information for the Advanced Tactical Fighter project in May 1981, which resulted in the F-22.[39] The USMC is leveraging the USAF's experience with \"fifth-generation air warfare\" in the F-22, as they develop their own tactics for the F-35.[40] According to Lockheed Martin in 2004, the only fifth-generation jet fighter then in operational service was their own F-22 Raptor.[2][41] Lockheed Martin uses \"fifth-generation fighter\" to describe the F-22 and F-35 fighters, with the definition including \"advanced stealth\", \"extreme performance\", \"information fusion\" and \"advanced sustainment\".[2][42] For unknown reasons, their definition no longer includes supercruise capability, which has typically been associated with the more advanced modern fighters, but which the F-35 lacks.[43] Lockheed Martin attempted to trademark the term \"5th generation fighters\" in association with jet aircraft and structural parts thereof,[44] and has a trademark for a logo with the term.[45] The definition of the term fifth-generation fighter from Lockheed Martin has been criticized by companies whose products do not conform to these particular specifications, such as Boeing and Eurofighter, and by other commentators such as Bill Sweetman:[46] \"it is misleading to portray the F-22 and F-35 as a linear evolution in fighter design. Rather, they are a closely related pair of outliers, relying on a higher level of stealth as a key element of survivability – as the Lockheed YF-12 and Mikoyan MiG-25, in the 1960s, relied on speed and altitude.\"[47] The United States Navy and Boeing have placed the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in a \"next generation\" fighter category along with the F-22 and F-35,[48] as the Super Hornet has a \"fifth-generation\" AESA radar, modest radar cross-section (RCS) reductions and sensor fusion.[49][50] A senior USAF pilot has complained about fifth-generation claims for the Super Hornet: \"The whole point to fifth generation is the synergy of stealth, fusion and complete situational awareness. The point about fifth-generation aircraft is that they can do their mission anywhere – even in sophisticated integrated air defense [IADS] environments. If you fly into heavy IADS with a great radar and sensor fusion, but no stealth, you will have complete situational awareness of the guy that kills you.\"[51] Michael \"Ponch\" Garcia of Raytheon has said that the addition of their AESA radars to the Super Hornet provides \"90 percent of your fifth-generation capability at half the cost.\"[52] Additionally, a top Boeing official has called their newest 4.5 generation fighters \"stealth killers\".[53] China has two stealth fighter aircraft, Chengdu J-20 and Shenyang J-35, both classified as fifth-generation fighter by United States Department of Defense and Defense Intelligence Agency.[54][55] By the late 1990s, several Chinese fifth-generation fighter programs, grouped under the program codename J-XX or XXJ, were identified by western intelligence sources. PLAAF officials have confirmed the existence of such a program, which they estimated would enter service between 2017 and 2019.[56][57] By late 2010, two prototypes of the Chengdu J-20 had been constructed and were undergoing high-speed taxi trials.[58] The J-20 made its first flight on 11 January 2011.[59] On 26 December 2015, a new J-20 with serial number 2101 was seen leaving its Chengdu Aviation Corporation factory. It is believed to be the first of the low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft.[60] 2101 conducted its maiden flight on 18 January 2016.[61] The J-20 officially entered training unit service in March 2017,[4] becoming the first operational stealth fighter outside of the United States and in Asia.[62] The J-20 underwent testing and exercises in late 2017,[63] and was inducted into PLAAF combat units in 2018.[64] Another stealth fighter design from SAC started to circulate on the internet in September 2011.[65] In June 2012, photos about a possible prototype of F-60 being transferred on highway began to emerge on the internet.[66] This aircraft was named Shenyang FC-31 later, and made its maiden flight on 31 October 2012.[67] Serial production version of the FC-31 was dubbed as Shenyang J-35.[68] On 3 September 2025, China officially debuted Shenyang J-35A for the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and Shenyang J-35 for People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), while PLAAF also received the upgraded Chengdu J-20A and J-20S variants, as reported by Chinese state media China Daily.[5] Technology demonstrators included the Mikoyan Project 1.44 – 1998 (1 built) and Su-47 – 1997 (1 built). In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union outlined the need for a next-generation aircraft to replace its fourth-generation jet fighters, the Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27, in front line service. To meet the characteristics for the next-generation aircraft, work was underway on two aircraft projects: the twin-engined delta canard Sukhoi Su-47 with forward-swept wings and the Mikoyan Project 1.44. However, due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and lack of funds, both remained only as technology demonstrators. After 2000, the Russian Defence Ministry initiated a new fighter competition known as \"PAK FA\" (Russian: ПАК ФА, short for: Перспективный авиационный комплекс фронтовой авиации, romanized: Perspektivny Aviatsionny Kompleks Frontovoy Aviatsii, lit. ''Prospective aeronautical complex of front-line air forces'') to develop a next-generation fighter for the Russian Air Force, with Sukhoi and MiG as the main competitors. Sukhoi came up with its heavier, two-engine T-50 proposal (now Sukhoi Su-57) while Mikoyan proposed a light, single-engine Mikoyan LMFS design, based on the former MiG-1.44 project.[69] Sukhoi won the competition and in 2002, it was selected to lead the development of Russia's next-generation fighter based on the T-50 design. Later development of the multirole Mikoyan LMFS were continued from MiG funding.[70] However Mikoyan LMFS program was also cancelled and replaced by similar Sukhoi Checkmate program. Russia's first fifth-generation aircraft, the Sukhoi Su-57, will replace its aging MiG-29s and Su-27s.[71][72] The Su-57 first flew on 29 January 2010. The first production Su-57 was delivered to the Russian Air Force on 25 December 2020.[73] The Mikoyan PAK DP is another proposed fifth-generation fighter, being developed to replace the MiG-31.[74][75][76][77] The project began in 2010, and \"According to Russian news reports, the MiG-41 will be equipped with stealth technology, reach a speed of Mach 4–4.3, carry anti-satellite missiles, and be able to perform tasks in Arctic and near-space environments.\"[78] Russia unveiled a prototype of the single-engine Sukhoi Su-75 Checkmate Light Tactical Aircraft in July 2021 at the biennial MAKS (air show), with maiden flight initially expected in 2023 (subsequently delayed to at least 2024). The fighter is mainly designed for export and is expected to be less costly than 2-engine competitors.[79] The TAI TF-X Kaan,[82] or in Turkish as Milli Muharip Uçak (MMU, National Combat Aircraft),[83] is a stealth, twin-engine, all-weather, fifth generation air superiority fighter in development by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) and BAE Systems as its sub-contractor. The TF-X is planned to replace the F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft of the Turkish Air Force and to be exported to foreign states.[84] Taxiing and ground running tests of the prototype began two days before the scheduled roll-out, on March 16, 2023.[80][85] It was officially given the name \"Kaan\" on May 1, 2023.[86][87][81] On 21 February 2024, the first Kaan prototype took its 13-minute maiden flight, taking off from Mürted Airfield Command in Ankara, Turkey.[88][89] This prototype uses General Electric F110 engines, also used in the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. In June 2024, KAI announced plans to add internal weapon bays to its 4.5 generation KF-21 Boramae, as part of its KF-21EX 5th generation enhancement programme.[90] India is independently developing a twin-engine fifth-generation supermaneuverable stealth multirole fighter, called the HAL Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA). It is being developed and designed by the Aeronautical Development Agency and will be manufactured by a SPV with initial prototypes produced by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. As of 2025, the AMCA prototype was under construction, with a first flight of the prototype expected by 2028.[91][92][93][94] In early 2018, India pulled out of the parallel project called FGFA, a fifth-generation derivative of the Sukhoi Su-57, which it alleged did not meet requirements for stealth, combat avionics, radars and sensors by that time.[95] The completed FGFA was to include 43 improvements over the Su-57, including stealth, supercruise, advanced sensors, networking and combat avionics.[96][97] Saab's Flygsystem 2020 is a program to develop a fifth generation fighter.[98][99] Japan developed a prototype of a stealth jet fighter called the Mitsubishi X-2 Shinshin, previously referred to as the ATD-X. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Japan, seeking to replace its aging fleet of fighter aircraft, began making overtures to the United States on the topic of purchasing F-22 fighters for their own forces.[100] However the U.S. Congress had banned the exporting of the aircraft in order to safeguard secrets of the aircraft's technology such as its extensive use of stealth; this rejection necessitated Japan's development of its own modern fighter, to be equipped with stealth features and other advanced systems.[101] A mock-up of the X-2 Shinshin was constructed and used to study the radar cross section in France in 2009. The first prototype rolled out in July 2014 and the aircraft made its first flight on 22 April 2016. By July 2018, Japan had gleaned sufficient information, and decided that it would need to bring on international partners to complete this project. Several companies have responded.[102] Japan has signed a contract with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to develop a sixth-generation fighter called Mitsubishi F-X. 11.5 m (37 ft 9 in)"}

Aircraft include fixed-wing and rotary-wing types, morphable wings, wing-less lifting bodies, as well as lighter-than-air aircraft such as hot air balloons and airships. Aviation began in the 18th century with the development of the hot air balloon, an apparatus capable of atmospheric displacement through buoyancy. Clément Ader built the \"Ader Éole\" in France and made an uncontrolled, powered hop in 1890. This was the first powered aircraft, although it did not achieve controlled flight. Some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of Otto Lilienthal in 1896. A major leap followed with the construction of the Wright Flyer, the first powered airplane by the Wright brothers in the early 1900s. Since that time, aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the jet engine which enabled aviation to become a major form of transport throughout the world. In 2024, there were 9.5 billion passengers worldwide according to the ICAO.[1] As of 2018, estimates suggest that 11% of the world's population traveled by air, with up to 4% taking international flights.[2] The word aviation was coined by the French writer and former naval officer Gabriel de La Landelle in 1863.[3] He originally derived the term from the verb avier (an unsuccessful neologism for \"to fly\"), itself derived from the Latin word avis (\"bird\") and the suffix -ation.[4] There are early legends of human flight such as the stories of Icarus in Greek myth, Jamshid and Shah Kay Kāvus in Persian myth,[5] and the flying automaton of Archytas of Tarentum (428–347 BC).[6] Later, somewhat more credible claims[according to whom?] of short-distance human flights appear, such as the winged flights of Abbas ibn Firnas (810–887, recorded in the 17th century), Eilmer of Malmesbury (11th century, recorded in the 12th century) and the hot-air Passarola of Bartholomeu Lourenço de Gusmão (1685–1724).[7] The modern age of aviation began with the first untethered human lighter-than-air flight on November 21, 1783, of a hot air balloon designed by the Montgolfier brothers.[8] The usefulness of balloons was limited because they could only travel downwind. The first steerable dirigible, balloon was flown by Jean-Pierre Blanchard in 1784. It was human-powered and, Blanchard completed a successful crossing of the English Channel in one in 1785. Rigid airships became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances. The best-known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German Zeppelin company. The most successful Zeppelin was the Graf Zeppelin. It flew over one million miles, including an around-the-world flight in August 1929. However, the dominance of the Zeppelins over the airplanes of that period, which had a range of only a few hundred miles, was diminishing as airplane design advanced. The \"Golden Age\" of the airships ended on May 6, 1937.[according to whom?] That year the Hindenburg caught fire, killing 36 people. The cause of the Hindenburg accident was initially blamed on the use of hydrogen instead of helium as the lift gas. An internal investigation by the manufacturer found that the coating used in the material covering the frame was highly flammable and allowed static electricity to build up in the airship.[9] Changes to the coating formulation reduced the risk of further Hindenburg type accidents. Although there have been periodic initiatives to revive their use, airships have seen only niche application since that time.[10] There had been previous airship accidents that were more fatal, for instance, a British R38 on 23 August 1921,[11] but the Hindenburg was the first to be captured on newsreel.[12] In 1799, Sir George Cayley set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion and control.[14][15] Otto Lilienthal was the first person to make well-documented, repeated, successful flights with gliders,[16] therefore making the idea of \"heavier than air\" a reality. Newspapers and magazines published photographs of Lilienthal gliding, favorably influencing public and scientific opinion about the possibility of flying machines becoming practical. Lilienthal's work led him to develop the concept of the modern wing.[17][18] His flight attempts in Berlin in 1891 are seen as the beginning of human flight[19] and the Lilienthal Normalsegelapparat is considered to be the first airplane in series production, making the Maschinenfabrik Otto Lilienthal in Berlin the first air plane production company in the world.[20] Lilienthal is often referred to as either the \"father of aviation\"[21][22][23] or \"father of flight\".[24] The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw dirigible developments, such as Henri Giffard's included machine-powered propulsion Giffard dirigible in 1852, David Schwarz' rigid frame dirigible in 1896 and Alberto Santos-Dumont's improvements to speed and maneuverability in 1901. There are many competing claims for the earliest powered, heavier-than-air flight. The first recorded powered flight was carried out by Clément Ader on October 9, 1890, in his bat-winged, fully self-propelled fixed-wing aircraft, the Ader Éole. It was reportedly the first manned, powered, heavier-than-air flight of a significant distance of 50 meters (160 ft), but insignificant altitude from level ground.[25][26][27] Seven years later, on October 14, 1897, Ader's Avion III was tested without success in front of two officials from the French War ministry. The report on the trials was not publicized until 1910, as they had been a military secret. In November 1906, Ader said that he made a successful flight on October 14, 1897 and achieved an uninterrupted flight of around 300 meters (980 feet). Although widely believed at the time, these claims were later discredited.[28][29] The Wright brothers made the first successful powered, controlled and sustained airplane flight on December 17, 1903, a feat made possible by their invention of three-axis control[30] and in-house development of an engine with a sufficient power-to-weight ratio.[31] A decade later, at the start of World War I, heavier-than-air powered aircraft had become practical for reconnaissance, artillery spotting and attacks against ground positions. Aircraft began to transport people and cargo as designs grew larger and more reliable. The Wright brothers took aloft the first passenger, Charles Furnas, one of their mechanics, on May 14, 1908.[32][33] During the 1920s and 1930s great progress was made in the field of aviation, including the first transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown in 1919, Charles Lindbergh's solo transatlantic flight in 1927 and Charles Kingsford Smith's transpacific flight the following year. One of the most successful designs of this period was the Douglas DC-3, which became the first airliner to be profitable carrying passengers exclusively, starting the modern era of passenger airline service. By the beginning of World War II, many towns and cities had built airports, and there were numerous qualified pilots available. During World War II one of the first jet engines was developed by Hans von Ohain and accomplished the world's first jet-powered flight in 1939.[34] The war brought many innovations to aviation, including the first jet aircraft and the first liquid-fueled rockets. After World War II, especially in North America, there was a boom in general aviation, both private and commercial, as thousands of pilots were released from military service and many inexpensive war-surplus transport and training aircraft became available. Manufacturers such as Cessna, Piper, and Beechcraft expanded production to provide light aircraft for the new middle-class market. By the 1950s, the development of civil jets grew, beginning with the de Havilland Comet, though the first widely used passenger jet was the Boeing 707, because it was much more economical than other aircraft at that time. At the same time, turboprop propulsion started to appear for smaller commuter planes, making it possible to serve small-volume routes in a much wider range of weather conditions. Since the 1960s composite material airframes and quieter, more efficient engines have become available, and Concorde provided supersonic passenger service for more than two decades. However, the most important lasting innovations have taken place in instrumentation and control. The arrival of solid-state electronics, the Global Positioning System, satellite communications, and increasingly small and powerful computers and LED displays, have dramatically changed the cockpits of airliners and, increasingly, of smaller aircraft as well. Pilots can navigate much more accurately and view terrain, obstructions, and other nearby aircraft on a map or through synthetic vision, even at night or in low visibility. On June 21, 2004, SpaceShipOne became the first privately funded aircraft to make a spaceflight, opening the possibility of an aviation market capable of leaving the Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, the need to decarbonize the aviation industry to face the climate crisis has increased research into aircraft powered by alternative fuels, such as ethanol, electricity, hydrogen, and solar energy, with flying prototypes becoming more common. Civil aviation includes all non-military flying, both general aviation and scheduled air transport. There are seven major manufacturers of civil transport aircraft: Boeing, Airbus, Ilyushin and Tupolev concentrate on wide-body and narrow-body jet airliners, while Bombardier, Embraer and Sukhoi concentrate on regional airliners. Large networks of specialized parts suppliers from around the world support these manufacturers, who sometimes provide only the initial design and final assembly in their own plants. The Chinese ACAC consortium has also recently[when?] entered the civil transport market with its Comac ARJ21 regional jet.[35][36] Until the 1970s, most major airlines were flag carriers, sponsored by their governments and heavily protected from competition. Since then, open skies agreements have resulted in increased competition and choice for consumers, coupled with falling prices for airlines. The combination of high fuel prices, low fares, high salaries, as well as crises such as the September 11 attacks and the SARS pandemic have driven many older airlines to government-bailouts, bankruptcy or mergers. At the same time, low-cost carriers such as Ryanair, Southwest and WestJet have flourished. General aviation includes all non-scheduled civil flying, both private and commercial. General aviation may include business flights, air charter, private aviation, flight training, ballooning, paragliding, parachuting, gliding, hang gliding, aerial photography, foot-launched powered hang gliders, air ambulance, crop dusting, charter flights, traffic reporting, police air patrols and forest fire fighting. Each country regulates aviation differently, but general aviation usually falls under different regulations depending on whether it is private or commercial and on the type of equipment involved. Many small aircraft manufacturers serve the general aviation market, with a focus on private aviation and flight training. The most important recent developments[which?][when?] for small aircraft, which form the bulk of the GA fleet, have been the introduction of advanced avionics (including GPS) that were formerly found only in large airliners, and the introduction of composite materials to make small aircraft lighter and faster. Ultralight and homebuilt aircraft have also become increasingly popular for recreational use, since in most countries that allow private aviation, they are much less expensive and less heavily regulated than certified aircraft. Simple balloons were used as surveillance aircraft as early as the 18th century. Over the years, military aircraft have been built to meet ever increasing capability requirements. Manufacturers of military aircraft compete for contracts to supply their government's arsenal. Aircraft are selected based on factors like cost, performance and the speed of production. Aviation safety means the state of an aviation system or organization in which risks associated with aviation activities, related to, or in direct support of the operation of aircraft, are reduced and controlled to an acceptable level. It encompasses the theory, practice, investigation, and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education, and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel. A maintenance, repair, and overhaul organization (MRO) is a firm that ensures airworthiness or air transport. According to a 2024 article, \"maintenance (M) involves inspecting, cleaning, oiling, and changing aircraft parts after a certain number of flight hours. Repair (R) is restoring the original function of parts and components. Overhaul (O) refers to extensive maintenance, the complete refurbishment of the aircraft, and upgrades in avionics, which can take several weeks to complete.\"[38] Airlines are legally obligated to certify airworthiness, meaning that a civil aviation authority must approve an aircraft suitable for safe flight operations.[39] MRO firms are responsible for this process, thoroughly checking and documenting all components' repairs while tracking mechanical, propulsion, and electronic parts.[40] Aviation regulators oversee maintenance practices in the country of aircraft registration, manufacture, or current location. All aircraft maintenance activities must adhere to international regulations that mandate standards.[41][38] An aviation accident is defined by the Convention on International Civil Aviation Annex 13 as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, in which a person is fatally or seriously injured, the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure or the aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible.[42] An accident in which the damage to the aircraft is such that it must be written off, or in which the plane is destroyed, is called a hull loss accident.[43] The first fatal aviation accident occurred in a Wright Model A aircraft at Fort Myer (now part of Joint Base Myer–Henderson Hall) in Virginia, on September 17, 1908, resulting in injury to the pilot, Orville Wright, and death of the passenger, Signal Corps Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge. The worst aviation accident in history was the Tenerife airport disaster on March 27, 1977, when 583 people died when two Boeing 747 jumbo jets, operated by Pan Am and KLM collided on a runway in Los Rodeos airport, now known as Tenerife North. An aviation incident is defined as an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operations.[43] Air traffic control (ATC) involves communication with aircraft to help maintain separation – that is, they ensure that aircraft are sufficiently far enough apart horizontally or vertically for no risk of collision. Controllers may co-ordinate position reports provided by pilots, or in high traffic areas they may use radar to see aircraft positions. Becoming an air traffic controller in the United States typically requires an associate or bachelor's degree from the Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative. The FAA also requires extensive training, along with medical examinations and background checks. Some controllers are required to work weekend, night, and holiday shifts.[44] There are generally four different types of ATC: ATC is especially important for aircraft flying under instrument flight rules (IFR) when they may be in weather conditions that do not allow the pilots to see other aircraft. However, in very high-traffic areas, especially near major airports, aircraft flying under visual flight rules (VFR) are also required to follow instructions from ATC. In addition to separation from other aircraft, ATC may provide weather advisories, terrain separation, navigation assistance, and other services to pilots, depending on their workload. ATC does not control all flights. The majority of Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flights in the United States and Canada are not required to contact ATC unless they are passing through a busy terminal area or using a major airport, and in many areas, such as northern Canada and low altitude in northern Scotland, air traffic control services are not available, even for IFR flights at lower altitudes. Like all activities involving combustion, operating powered aircraft, from airliners to hot air balloons, releases soot and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) are also produced. In addition, there are environmental impacts specific to aviation: for instance: Another environmental impact of aviation is noise pollution, mainly caused by aircraft taking off and landing. Sonic booms were a problem with supersonic aircraft such as the Concorde. Air transportation is a mode of travel and commerce, involving the movement of people, goods, and animals through the atmosphere using aircraft such as airplanes and helicopters. It is a major mode for the overall transportation system, because of its speed and the ability to cover long distances quickly, connecting remote regions and major economic hubs. It plays a significant role in global trade and passenger mobility, influencing economic development and international relations.[49] However, its share of CO2 emissions is significant, accounting for 2% of global CO2 emissions in 2023, having grown faster between 2000 and 2019 than rail, road or shipping.[50] Even under the High Ambition scenario, where total emissions are reduced significantly, aviation emissions will still be a major concern.[51] The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has highlighted the need for ambitious policies in order to achieve significant reductions in aviation emissions, projecting that CO2 emissions from aviation could be lowered by up to 50% by 2050 with the right measures in place.[52] The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) also emphasizes the potential of accelerating the transition to sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) and implementing efficiency technologies for both commercial and cargo aircraft to achieve significant emission reductions.[53] These commitments reflect a concerted effort by global organizations to address the climate impact of the aviation sector. Two significant megatrends are observed in terms of air transport innovation, sustainability and digitalization. A report published by WIPO in 2025 showed a steady increase of patents publication in air transportation, the majority of which being related to communication and security, followed by sustainable propulsion.[54] Sustainable Propulsion technologies are being developed to reduce emissions and improve environmental sustainability. Efficient aircraft turbines are used to improve fuel efficiency, reduce emissions and lower noise levels. Aviation biofuels aim for a reduction in CO2 emissions compared to traditional jet fuel. Battery-based electric and/or hybrid aircraft are being developed for short-haul and regional flights. Hydrogen-powered aircraft are intended for long-haul flights and heavy-duty applications.[55] Automation and Circularity technologies are promoting efficient material use, smart production and robotics, and enhanced recycling practices.[55] Communication and Security technologies are revolutionizing[peacock prose] air transportation by improving operational efficiency, safety and customer experience. They include navigation technologies such as advanced air traffic management (ATM) systems, device-to-device technology, cloud computing, low-latency internet, and cybersecurity.[55] Analysis by McKinsey & Company has stated that the rise in digital technologies has made aviation systems more vulnerable to cyberattacks, emphasizing the need for robust cybersecurity measures.[56] Advanced Human– Machine Interfaces, such as extended reality technologies, speech recognition technology, facial recognition technology, touch displays and data gloves, and head-up displays, are making interactions more intuitive, secure, and responsive, thereby improving operational efficiency and user experience.[55] The air transportation sector is undergoing a surge in patenting activity, with annual Air transport-related patent families increasing from under 1,100 in 2000 to over 12,800 in 2023 – a growth of 11%. China, the South Korea, and Japan stand out for their high patent volumes and significant growth rates, although they exhibit a relatively low Relative Specialization Index, reflecting a broad approach to innovation at the country-level across various sectors. In contrast, France, the United States and Canada demonstrate a high degree of specialization in Air transportation technologies reflecting a concentrated focus on advancing specific innovations in aviation.[57] Leading aviation companies such as RTX, General Electric, Safran, Boeing, Rolls-Royce Holdings, and Honeywell International dominate the patent filings. The Aero Engine Corporation of China leads in recent growth with a compound annual growth rate of 81.1%. Generally, Chinese patent owners exhibit strong recent growth in air transport patent, in contrast to the other top patentees.[timeframe?] Mitsubishi Electric in Japan is as the only non-Chinese entity among the fastest-growing patent owners, highlighting its strategic emphasis on Air transportation research and innovation.[peacock prose] The diverse landscape underscores the dynamic interplay of high-volume patenting and strategic specialization across different regions, driven by both established aviation multinationals and emerging players.[57]"}

This includes preventing aviation accidents and incidents through research, training aviation personnel, protecting passengers and the general public, and designing safer aircraft and aviation infrastructure. The aviation industry is subject to significant regulations and oversight to reduce risks across all aspects of flight.[1] Adverse weather conditions such as turbulence, thunderstorms, icing, and reduced visibility are also recognized as major contributing factors to aviation safety outcomes.[2] Aviation security is focused on protecting air travelers, aircraft and infrastructure from intentional harm or disruption, rather than unintentional mishaps.[3] Aviation is safer today than it has ever been. Modern commercial aviation boasts an accident rate of approximately 1 fatal accident per 16 million flights, far lower than historic numbers.[2] On December 14, 1903, the Wright Brothers conducted a test flight of their powered airplane from the slope of Big Kill Devil Hill in North Carolina. Upon takeoff, the airplane lifted about 15 feet off the ground, stalled, and crashed into the sand.[5] Only three days later, on December 17, 1903, Wilbur's brother, Orville Wright flew the airplane for the world's first powered, sustained, and controlled heavier-than-air flight in history. Although the failed test flight on December 14 would be mostly forgotten in aviation, it remains one of the earliest recorded aviation accidents in history. In the early years of air travel, accidents were exceedingly common. 1929 was named the year of \"The Great Crash\" due to the frequency of aircraft accidents that occurred during the year, with 24 fatal accidents officially reported.[6] In 1928 and 1929, the overall accident rate was about 1 in every million miles (1.6 million kilometers) flown.[6] In today's industry, that accident rate would translate to about 7,000 fatal accidents each year. For the ten-year period 2002 to 2011, 0.6 fatal accidents happened per one million flights globally, 0.4 per million hours flown, 22.0 fatalities per one million flights or 12.7 per million hours flown.[7] From 310 million passengers in 1970, air transport had grown to 3,696 million in 2016, led by 823 million in the United States, then 488 million in China.[8] In 2016, 19 fatal accidents involved civil airliners with more than 14 passengers. These accidents resulted in 325 fatalities, the second safest year ever after 2015 with 16 accidents and 2013 with 265 fatalities.[9] For planes heavier than 5.7 metric tones, there were 34.9 million departures and 75 accidents worldwide with 7 of these fatal for 182 fatalities, the lowest since 2013 : 5.21 fatalities per million departures.[10] In 2017, there were 10 fatal airliner accidents, resulting in 44 occupant fatalities and 35 persons on the ground: the safest year ever for commercial aviation, both by the number of fatal accidents as well as in fatalities.[11] By 2019, fatal accidents per million flights decreased 12 fold since 1970, from 6.35 to 0.51, and fatalities per trillion revenue passenger kilometre (RPK) decreased 81 fold from 3,218 to 40.[12] Runway safety represents 36% of accidents, ground safety 18% and loss of control in-flight 16%.[10] Loss of control inflight represents 35% of the fatal accidents, Controlled flight into terrain 21%, runway excursions 17%, system or component failure: 6%, Touchdown off the runway: 5%, Abnormal Runway Contact: 4% and fire: 2%.[3] Safety has improved from better aircraft design process, engineering and maintenance, the evolution of navigation aids, and safety protocols and procedures. There are three main ways in which the risk of fatality in a certain mode of travel can be measured: (1) deaths per billion typical journeys taken, (2) deaths per billion hours traveled, and (3) deaths per billion kilometers traveled. The following table displays these statistics for the United Kingdom (1990–2000),[13] and has been appended. (Note that aviation safety does not include travelling to the airport.)[14][failed verification] The first two statistics are computed for typical travels by their respective forms of transport, so they cannot be used directly to compare risks related to different forms of transport in a particular travel \"from A to B\". For example, these statistics suggest that a typical flight from Los Angeles to New York would carry a larger risk factor than a typical car travel from home to office. However, car travel from Los Angeles to New York would not be typical; that journey would be as long as several dozen typical car travels, and thus the associated risk would be larger as well. Because the journey would take a much longer time, the overall risk associated with making this journey by car would be higher than making the same journey by air, even if each individual hour of car travel is less risky than each hour of flight. For risks associated with long-range intercity travel, the most suitable statistic is the third one: deaths per billion kilometers. Still, this statistic can lose credence in situations where the availability of an air option makes an otherwise inconvenient journey possible. Aviation industry insurers base their calculations on the deaths per journey statistic while the aviation industry itself generally uses the deaths per kilometre statistic in press releases.[21] Since 1997, the number of fatal air accidents has been no more than 1 for every 2,000,000,000 person-miles[c] flown,[citation needed] and thus is one of the safest modes of transportation when measured by distance traveled. The Economist notes that air travel is safer by distance travelled, but trains are as safe as planes.[22] It also notes that cars are four times more hazardous for deaths per time travelled, and cars and trains are respectively three times and six times safer than planes by number of journeys taken.[22] Because the above figures are focused on providing a perspective to the realm of everyday transportation, air travel is taken to include only standard civil passenger aviation, as offered commercially to the general public. Military and special-purpose aircraft are excluded. Between 1990 and 2015, there were 1874 commuter and air taxi accidents in the U.S. of which 454 (24%) were fatal, resulting in 1,296 deaths, including 674 accidents (36%) and 279 fatalities (22%) in Alaska alone.[23] The number of deaths per passenger-mile on commercial airlines in the United States between 2000 and 2010 was about 0.2 deaths per 10 billion passenger-miles.[24][25] For driving, the rate was 150 per 10 billion vehicle-miles for 2000: 750 times higher per mile than for flying in a commercial airplane. There were no fatalities on large scheduled commercial airlines in the United States for over nine years, between the Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash in February 2009, and a catastrophic engine failure on Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 in April 2018.[26] Another aspect of safety is protection from intentional harm or property damage, also known as security. The terrorist attacks of 2001 are not counted as accidents. However, even if they were counted as accidents they would have added about 1 death per billion person-miles. Two months later, American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in New York City, killing 265 people, including 5 on the ground, causing 2001 to show a very high fatality rate. Even so, the rate that year including the attacks (estimated here to be about 4 deaths per billion person-miles), is safe compared to some other forms of transport when measured by distance traveled. The first aircraft electrical or electronic device avionics system was Lawrence Sperry's autopilot, demonstrated in June 1914.[27] The Transcontinental Airway System chain of beacons was built by the Commerce Department in 1923 to guide airmail flights.[27] Gyrocopters were developed by Juan de la Cierva to avoid stall and spin accidents, and for that invented cyclic and collective controls used by helicopters.[27] The first flight of a gyrocopter was on 17 January 1923. During the 1920s, the first laws were passed in the United States of America to regulate civil aviation, notably the Air Commerce Act of 1926, which required pilots and aircraft to be examined and licensed, for accidents to be properly investigated, and for the establishment of safety rules and navigation aids; under the Aeronautics Branch of the United States Department of Commerce (US DoC). A network of aerial lighthouses was established in the United Kingdom and Europe during the 1920s and 1930s.[28] Use of the lighthouses has declined with the advent of radio navigation aids such as non-directional beacon (NDB), VHF omnidirectional range (VOR), and distance measuring equipment (DME). The last operational aerial lighthouse in the United Kingdom is on top of the cupola over the RAF College main hall at RAF Cranwell. One of the first aids for air navigation to be introduced in the United States in the late 1920s was airfield lighting, to assist pilots in making landings in poor weather or after dark. The Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) was developed from this in the 1930s, indicating to the pilot the angle of descent to the airfield. This later became adopted internationally through the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Jimmy Doolittle developed instrument rating and made his first 'blind' flight in September 1929. The March 1931 wooden wing failure of a Transcontinental & Western Air Fokker F-10 carrying Knute Rockne, coach of the University of Notre Dame's football team, reinforced all-metal airframes and led to a more formal accident investigation system. On 4 September 1933, a Douglas DC-1 test flight was conducted with one of the two engines shut down during the takeoff run, climbed to 8,000 feet (2,438 metres), and completed its flight, proving twin aircraft engine safety. With greater range than lights and weather immunity, radio navigation aids were first used in the 1930s, like the Australian Aeradio stations guiding transport flights, with a light beacon and a modified Lorenz beam transmitter (the German blind-landing equipment preceding the modern instrument landing system - ILS).[27] ILS was first used by a scheduled flight to make a landing in a snowstorm at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1938, and a form of ILS was adopted by the ICAO for international use in 1949. Hard runways were built worldwide for World War II to avoid waves and floating hazards plaguing seaplanes.[27] Developed by the U.S. and introduced during World War II, LORAN replaced the sailors' less reliable compass and celestial navigation over water and survived until it was replaced by the Global Positioning System.[27] Following the development of radar in World War II, it was deployed as a landing aid for civil aviation in the form of ground-controlled approach (GCA) systems then as the airport surveillance radar as an aid to air traffic control in the 1950s. A number of ground-based weather radar systems can detect areas of severe turbulence. A modern Honeywell Intuvue weather system visualizes weather patterns up to 300 miles (480 km) away.[citation needed] Distance measuring equipment (DME) in 1948 and VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) stations became the main route navigation means during the 1960s, superseding the low frequency radio ranges and the non-directional beacon (NDB): the ground-based VOR stations were often co-located with DME transmitters and the pilots could establish their bearing and distance to the station.[29] To highlight the jetliner evolution, Airbus split them in four generations: The fatal accident rate fell from 3.0 per million flights for the first generation to 0.9 for the next, 0.3 for the third and 0.1 for the last.[3] With the arrival of Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), satellite navigation has become accurate enough for altitude as well as positioning use, and is being used increasingly for instrument approaches as well as en-route navigation. However, because the GPS constellation is a single point of failure, on-board Inertial Navigation System (INS) or ground-based navigation aids are still required for backup. In 2017, Rockwell Collins reported it had become more costly to certify than to develop a system, from 75% engineering and 25% certification in past years.[30] It calls for a global harmonization between certifying authorities to avoid redundant engineering and certification tests rather than recognizing the others approval and validation.[31] Groundings of entire classes of aircraft out of equipment safety concerns is unusual, but this has occurred to the de Havilland Comet in 1954 after multiple crashes due to metal fatigue and hull failure, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 in 1979 after the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 due to engine loss, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in 2013 after its battery problems, and the Boeing 737 MAX in 2019 after two crashes preliminarily tied to a flight control system. Parts manufactured without an aviation authority's approval are described as \"unapproved\". Unapproved parts include inferior counterfeits, those used beyond their time limits, those that were previously approved but not properly returned to service, those with fraudulent labels, production overruns that were not sold with the agency's permission, and those that are untraceable.[32] Unapproved faulty parts have caused hundreds of incidents and crashes, some fatal, including about 24 crashes between 2010 and 2016.[33][34] Foreign object debris (FOD) includes items left in the aircraft structure during manufacture/repairs, debris on the runway and solids encountered in flight (e.g. hail and dust). Such items can damage engines and other parts of the aircraft. In 2000, Air France Flight 4590 crashed after hitting a part that had fallen from a departing Continental Airlines DC-10.[35] A pilot misinformed by a printed document (manual, map, etc.), reacting to a faulty instrument or indicator (in the cockpit or on the ground),[36][37] or following inaccurate instructions or information from flight or ground control can lose situational awareness, or make errors, and accidents or near misses may result.[38][39][40][41] The crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 was a result of receiving and interpreting incorrect coordinates, which caused the pilots to inadvertently fly into a mountain. Boeing studies showed that airliners are struck by lightning twice per year on average; aircraft withstand typical lightning strikes without damage. The dangers of more powerful positive lightning were not understood until the destruction of a glider in 1999.[42] It has since been suggested that positive lightning might have caused the crash of Pan Am Flight 214 in 1963. At that time, aircraft were not designed to withstand such strikes because their existence was unknown. The 1985 standard in force in the US at the time of the glider crash, Advisory Circular AC 20-53A,[42] was replaced by Advisory Circular AC 20-53B in 2006.[43] However, it is unclear whether adequate protection against positive lightning was incorporated.[44][45] The effects of typical lightning on traditional metal-covered aircraft are well understood and serious damage from a lightning strike on an airplane is rare. Modern airliners like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner with exteriors and wings made from carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer have been tested and shown to receive no damage from lightning strikes during testing.[46] Ice and snow can be major factors in airline accidents. In 2005, Southwest Airlines Flight 1248 slid off the end of a runway after landing in heavy snow conditions, killing one child on the ground. Even a small amount of icing or coarse frost can greatly impair the ability of a wing to develop adequate lift, which is why regulations prohibit ice, snow or even frost on the wings or tail, prior to takeoff.[47] Air Florida Flight 90 crashed on takeoff in 1982, as a result of ice/snow on its wings. An accumulation of ice during flight can be catastrophic, as evidenced by the loss of control and subsequent crashes of American Eagle Flight 4184 in 1994, and Comair Flight 3272 in 1997. Both aircraft were turboprop airliners, with straight wings, which tend to be more susceptible to inflight ice accumulation, than are swept-wing jet airliners.[48] Airlines and airports ensure that aircraft are properly de-iced before takeoff whenever the weather involves icing conditions. Modern airliners are designed to prevent ice buildup on wings, engines, and tails (empennage) by either routing heated air from jet engines through the leading edges of the wing, and inlets,[49] or on slower aircraft, by use of inflatable rubber \"boots\" that expand to break off any accumulated ice. Airline flight plans require airline dispatch offices to monitor the progress of weather along the routes of their flights, helping the pilots to avoid the worst of inflight icing conditions. Aircraft can also be equipped with an ice detector in order to warn pilots to leave unexpected ice accumulation areas, before the situation becomes critical.[50] Pitot tubes in modern airplanes and helicopters have been provided with the function of \"Pitot Heating\" to prevent accidents like Air France Flight 447 caused by the pitot tube freezing and giving false readings. A wind shear is a change in wind speed and/or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere. A microburst is a localized column of sinking air that drops down in a thunderstorm. Both of these are potential weather threats that may cause an aviation accident.[51] Strong outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three-dimensional wind velocity just above ground level. Initially, this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed, which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear. As the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft, the localized headwind diminishes, reducing the aircraft's airspeed and increasing its sink rate. Then, when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft, the headwind becomes a tailwind, reducing lift generated by the wings, and leaving the aircraft in a low-power, low-speed descent. This can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries.[52] An engine may fail to function because of fuel starvation (e.g. British Airways Flight 38), fuel exhaustion (e.g. Air Canada Flight 143), foreign object damage (e.g. US Airways Flight 1549), mechanical failure due to metal fatigue (e.g. Kegworth air disaster, El Al Flight 1862, China Airlines Flight 358), mechanical failure due to improper maintenance (e.g. American Airlines Flight 191), mechanical failure caused by an original manufacturing defect in the engine (e.g. Qantas Flight 32, United Airlines Flight 232, Delta Air Lines Flight 1288), and pilot error (e.g. Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701). In a multi-engine aircraft, failure of a single engine usually results in a precautionary landing being performed, for example, landing at a diversion airport instead of continuing to the intended destination. Failure of a second engine (e.g. US Airways Flight 1549) or damage to other aircraft systems caused by an uncontained engine failure (e.g. United Airlines Flight 232) may, if an emergency landing is not possible, result in the aircraft crashing. Examples of failure of aircraft structures caused by metal fatigue include the de Havilland Comet accidents (1950s) and Aloha Airlines Flight 243 (1988). Improper repair procedures can also cause structural failures include Japan Air Lines Flight 123 (1985) and China Airlines Flight 611 (2002). Now that the subject is better understood, rigorous inspection and nondestructive testing procedures are in place. Composite materials consist of layers of fibers embedded in a resin matrix. In some cases, especially when subjected to cyclic stress, the layers of the material separate from each other (delaminate) and lose strength. As the failure develops inside the material, nothing is shown on the surface; instrument methods (often ultrasound-based) have to be used to detect such a material failure. In the 1940s several Yakovlev Yak-9s experienced delamination of plywood in their construction. An error in the design of the aircraft itself can be a cause of accidents, even if the error was not the primary cause of the accident. Examples of this are Lion Air Flight 610 (2018) and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 (2019), which both suffered a loss of control in flight leading to both planes crashing. The cause was discovered to be a design flaw in the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) software that was designed to improve the handling of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. But instead caused both aircraft to pitch nose down uncontrollably in flight due to a faulty angle of attack sensor, as the design allowed for only one sensor's readings to be used.[53] Another example is Airlines PNG Flight 1600 (2011) which suffered a fatal forced landing, primarily due to a engine failure. This failure was discovered to be caused by a design flaw in the power levers, which allowed the pilot to accidentally place the levers into reverse due to the design of the levers.[54] Stalling an aircraft (increasing the angle of attack to a point at which the wings fail to produce enough lift) is dangerous and can result in a crash if the pilot fails to make a timely correction. Devices to warn the pilot when the aircraft's speed is decreasing close to the stall speed include stall warning horns (now standard on virtually all powered aircraft), stick shakers, and voice warnings. Most stalls are a result of the pilot allowing the airspeed to be too slow for the particular weight and configuration at the time. Stall speed is higher when ice or frost has attached to the wings and/or tail stabilizer. The more severe the icing, the higher the stall speed, not only because smooth airflow over the wings becomes increasingly more difficult, but also because of the added weight of the accumulated ice. Crashes caused by a full stall of the airfoils include: Safety regulations control aircraft materials and the requirements for automated fire safety systems. Usually these requirements take the form of required tests. The tests measure flammability of materials and toxicity of smoke. When the tests fail, it is on a prototype in an engineering laboratory rather than in an aircraft. Fire and its toxic smoke have been the cause of accidents. An electrical fire on Air Canada Flight 797 in 1983 caused the deaths of 23 of the 46 passengers, resulting in the introduction of floor level lighting to assist people to evacuate a smoke-filled aircraft. In 1985, a fire on the runway caused the loss of 55 lives, 48 from the effects of incapacitating and subsequently lethal toxic gas and smoke in the British Airtours Flight 28M accident which raised serious concerns relating to survivability – something that had not been studied in such detail. The swift incursion of the fire into the fuselage and the layout of the aircraft impaired passengers' ability to evacuate, with areas such as the forward galley area becoming a bottle-neck for escaping passengers, with some dying very close to the exits. Much research into evacuation and cabin and seating layouts was carried out at Cranfield Institute to try to measure what makes a good evacuation route, which led to the seat layout by Overwing exits being changed by mandate and the examination of evacuation requirements relating to the design of galley areas. The use of smoke hoods or misting systems were also examined although both were rejected. South African Airways Flight 295 was lost in the Indian Ocean in 1987 after an in-flight fire in the cargo hold could not be suppressed by the crew. The cargo holds of most airliners are now equipped with automated halon fire extinguishing systems to combat a fire that might occur in the baggage holds. In May 1996, ValuJet Flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades a few minutes after takeoff because of a fire in the forward cargo hold. All 110 people on board were killed. At one time, fire fighting foam paths were laid down before an emergency landing, but the practice was considered only marginally effective, and concerns about the depletion of firefighting capability due to pre-foaming led the United States FAA to withdraw its recommendation in 1987. One possible cause of fires in airplanes is wiring problems that involve intermittent faults, such as wires with breached insulation touching each other, having water dripping on them, or short circuits. Notable was Swissair Flight 111 in 1998 due to an arc in the wiring of IFE which ignited flammable MPET insulation. These are difficult to detect once the aircraft is on the ground. However, there are methods, such as spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry, that can feasibly test live wires on aircraft during flight.[55] Bird strike is an aviation term for a collision between a bird and an aircraft. Fatal accidents have been caused by both engine failure following bird ingestion and bird strikes breaking cockpit windshields. Jet engines have to be designed to withstand the ingestion of birds of a specified weight and number and to not lose more than a specified amount of thrust. The weight and numbers of birds that can be ingested without hazarding the safe flight of the aircraft are related to the engine intake area.[56] The hazards of ingesting birds beyond the \"designed-for\" limit were shown on US Airways Flight 1549 when the aircraft struck Canada geese. The outcome of an ingestion event and whether it causes an accident, be it on a small fast plane, such as military jet fighters, or a large transport, depends on the number and weight of birds and where they strike the fan blade span or the nose cone. Core damage usually results with impacts near the blade root or on the nose cone. The highest risk of a bird strike occurs during takeoff and landing in the vicinity of airports, and during low-level flying, for example by military aircraft, crop dusters and helicopters. Some airports use active countermeasures, including a person with a shotgun, playing recorded sounds of predators through loudspeakers, or employing falconers. Poisonous grass can be planted that is not palatable to birds, nor to insects that attract insectivorous birds. Passive countermeasures involve sensible[clarification needed] land-use management, avoiding conditions attracting flocks of birds to the area (e.g. landfills). Another tactic found effective is to let the grass at the airfield grow taller (to approximately 12 inches or 30 centimetres) as some species of birds won't land if they cannot see one another. Human factors, including pilot error, are another potential set of factors, and currently the factor most commonly found in aviation accidents.[57][58] Much progress in applying human factors analysis to improving aviation safety was made around the time of World War II by such pioneers as Paul Fitts and Alphonse Chapanis. However, there has been progress in safety throughout the history of aviation, such as the development of the pilot's checklist in 1937.[59] CRM, or crew resource management, is a technique that makes use of the experience and knowledge of the complete flight crew to avoid dependence on just one crew member, and to improve pilot decision making. Pilot error and improper communication are often factors in the collision of aircraft. This can take place in the air (1978 Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 182) (TCAS) or on the ground (1977 Tenerife disaster) (RAAS). The barriers to effective communication have internal and external factors.[60] The ability of the flight crew to maintain situational awareness is a critical human factor in air safety. Human factors training is available to general aviation pilots and called single pilot resource management training. Failure of the pilots to properly monitor the flight instruments caused the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 in 1972. Controlled flight into terrain (CFIT), and error during take-off and landing can have catastrophic consequences, for example causing the crash of Prinair Flight 191 on landing, also in 1972. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines fatigue as \"A physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting from sleep loss or extended wakefulness, circadian phase, or workload.\"[61] The phenomenon places great risk on the crew and passengers of an airplane because it significantly increases the chance of pilot error.[62] Fatigue is particularly prevalent among pilots because of \"unpredictable work hours, long duty periods, circadian disruption, and insufficient sleep\".[63] These factors can occur together to produce a combination of sleep deprivation, circadian rhythm effects, and 'time-on task' fatigue.[63] Regulators attempt to mitigate fatigue by limiting the number of hours pilots are allowed to fly over varying periods of time. Experts in aviation fatigue[who?] often find that these methods fall short of their goals. Rarely, flight crew members are arrested or subject to disciplinary action for being intoxicated on the job. In 1990, three Northwest Airlines crew members were sentenced to jail for flying while drunk. In 2001, Northwest fired a pilot who failed a breathalyzer test after a flight. In July 2002, both pilots of America West Airlines Flight 556 were arrested just before they were scheduled to fly because they had been drinking alcohol. The pilots were fired and the FAA revoked their pilot licenses.[64] At least one fatal airliner accident involving drunk pilots occurred when Aero Flight 311 crashed at Kvevlax, Finland, killing all 25 on board in 1961. Another example is the crash Aeroflot Flight 821, in which the captain's intoxication contributed to the accident, killing all 88 on board. There have been rare instances of suicide by pilots. Although most air crew are screened for psychological fitness, a very few authorized pilots have flown acts of suicide and even mass murder.[65] In 1982, Japan Airlines Flight 350 crashed while on approach to the Tokyo Haneda Airport, killing 24 of the 174 on board. The official investigation found the mentally ill captain had attempted suicide by placing the inboard engines into reverse thrust, while the aircraft was close to the runway. The first officer did not have enough time to countermand before the aircraft stalled and crashed. In 1997, SilkAir Flight 185 suddenly went into a high dive from its cruising altitude. The speed of the dive was so high that the aircraft began to break apart before it finally crashed near Palembang, Sumatra. After three years of investigation, the Indonesian authorities declared that the cause of the accident could not be determined. However, the US NTSB concluded that deliberate suicide by the captain was the only reasonable explanation. In 1999 in the case of EgyptAir Flight 990, it appears that the first officer deliberately crashed into the Atlantic Ocean while the captain was away from his station.[66] Crew involvement is one of the speculative theories in the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 on 8 March 2014. On 24 March 2015, Germanwings Flight 9525 (an Airbus A320-200) crashed 100 kilometres (62 miles) north-west of Nice, in the French Alps, after a constant descent that began one minute after the last routine contact with air traffic control, and shortly after the aircraft had reached its assigned cruise altitude. All 144 passengers and six crew members were killed. The crash was intentionally caused by the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz. Having been declared 'unfit to work' without telling his employer, Lubitz reported for duty, and during the flight locked the captain out of the flight-deck. In response to the incident and the circumstances of Lubitz's involvement, aviation authorities in Canada, New Zealand, Germany, and Australia implemented new regulations that require two authorised personnel to be present in the cockpit at all times. Three days after the incident, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued a temporary recommendation for airlines to ensure that at least two crew members, including at least one pilot, are in the cockpit at all times of the flight. Several airlines announced they had already adopted similar policies voluntarily. Inaction, omission, failure to act as required, willful disregard of safety procedures, disdain for rules, and unjustifiable risk-taking by pilots have also led to accidents and incidents. Although Smartwings QS-1125 flight of 22 August 2019 successfully made an emergency landing at destination, the captain was censured for failing to follow mandatory procedures, including for not landing at the nearest possible diversion airport after an engine failure. Unsafe human factors are not limited to pilot errors. Third party factors include ground crew mishaps, ground vehicle to aircraft collisions and engineering maintenance related problems. For example, failure to properly close a cargo door on Turkish Airlines Flight 981 in 1974 caused the loss of the aircraft. (However, design of the cargo door latch was also a major factor in the accident.) In the case of Japan Air Lines Flight 123 in 1985, improper repair of previous damage led to explosive decompression of the cabin, which in turn destroyed the vertical stabilizer and damaged all four hydraulic systems which powered all the flight controls. Controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) is a class of accidents in which an aircraft is flown under control into terrain or man-made structures. CFIT accidents typically result from pilot error or of navigational system error. Failure to protect ILS critical areas can also cause CFIT accidents[dubious – discuss]. In December 1995, American Airlines Flight 965 tracked off course while approaching Cali, Colombia, and hit a mountainside despite a terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) terrain warning in the cockpit and desperate pilot attempt to gain altitude after the warning. Crew position awareness and monitoring of navigational systems are essential to the prevention of CFIT accidents. As of February 2008[update], over 40,000 aircraft had enhanced TAWS installed, and they had flown over 800 million hours without a CFIT accident.[67] Another anti-CFIT tool is the Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) system which monitors the altitudes transmitted by aircraft transponders and compares that with the system's defined minimum safe altitudes for a given area. When the system determines the aircraft is lower, or might soon be lower, than the minimum safe altitude, the air traffic controller receives an acoustic and visual warning and then alerts the pilot that the aircraft is too low.[68] The use of certain electronic equipment is partially or entirely prohibited as it might interfere with aircraft operation,[69] such as causing compass deviations.[citation needed] Use of some types of personal electronic devices is prohibited when an aircraft is below 10,000 feet (3,000 m), taking off, or landing. Use of a mobile phone is prohibited on most flights because in-flight usage creates problems with ground-based cells.[69][70] Wireless devices such as cellphones feature an airplane mode. Various ground support equipment operate in close proximity to the fuselage and wings to service the aircraft and occasionally cause accidental damage in the form of scratches in the paint or small dents in the skin. However, because aircraft structures (including the outer skin) play such a critical role in the safe operation of a flight, all damage is inspected, measured, and possibly tested to ensure that any damage is within safe tolerances. An example problem was the depressurization incident on Alaska Airlines Flight 536 in 2005. During ground services, a baggage handler hit the side of the aircraft with a tug towing a train of baggage carts. This damaged the metal skin of the aircraft. This damage was not reported and the plane departed. Climbing through 26,000 feet (7,900 m) the damaged section of the skin gave way under the difference in pressure between the inside of the aircraft and the outside air. The cabin depressurized explosively necessitating a rapid descent to denser (breathable) air and an emergency landing. Post-landing examination of the fuselage revealed a 12-inch (30 cm) hole on the right side of the airplane.[71] Plumes of volcanic ash near active volcanoes can damage propellers, engines and cockpit windows.[72] [73] In 1982, British Airways Flight 9 flew through an ash cloud and temporarily lost power from all four engines. The plane was badly damaged, with all the leading edges being scratched. The front windscreens had been so badly \"sand\" blasted by the ash that they could not be used to land the aircraft.[74] Prior to 2010 the general approach taken by airspace regulators was that if the ash concentration rose above zero, then the airspace was considered unsafe and was consequently closed.[75] Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers enable liaison between meteorologists, volcanologists, and the aviation industry.[76] Types of runway safety incidents include: The last two types can be prevented with airport surveillance and broadcast systems, a Runway Awareness and Advisory System, and landing navigation systems (e.g. transponder landing system, microwave landing system, instrument landing system). Aircrew are normally trained to handle hijack situations.[77][78] Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, stricter airport and airline security measures are in place to prevent terrorism, such as security checkpoints and locking the cockpit doors during flight. In the United States, the Federal Flight Deck Officer program is run by the Federal Air Marshal Service, with the aim of training active and licensed airline pilots to carry weapons and defend their aircraft against criminal activity and terrorism. Upon completion of government training, selected pilots enter a covert law enforcement and counter-terrorism service. Their jurisdiction is normally limited to a flight deck or a cabin of a commercial airliner or a cargo aircraft they operate while on duty. Passenger planes have rarely been attacked in both peacetime and war. Examples: Earlier tragedies investigations and improved engineering has allowed many safety improvements that have allowed an increasing safer aviation.[51] Airport design and location can have a large impact on aviation safety, especially since some airports such as Chicago Midway International Airport were originally built for propeller planes and many airports are in congested areas where it is difficult to meet newer safety standards. For instance, the FAA issued rules in 1999 calling for a runway safety area, usually extending 150 metres (500 ft) to each side and 300 metres (1,000 ft) beyond the end of a runway. This is intended to cover ninety percent of the cases of an aircraft leaving the runway by providing a buffer space free of obstacles.[80] Many older airports do not meet this standard. One method of substituting for the 300 metres (1,000 ft) at the end of a runway for airports in congested areas is to install an engineered materials arrestor system (EMAS). These systems are usually made of lightweight, crushable concrete that absorbs the energy of the aircraft to bring it to a rapid stop. As of 2008[update], they have stopped three aircraft at JFK Airport. According to a 2000 report by the National Transportation Safety Board, emergency aircraft evacuations happen about once every 11 days in the U.S. While some situations are extremely dire, such as when the plane is on fire, in many cases the greatest challenge for passengers can be the use of the evacuation slide. In a Time article on the subject, Amanda Ripley reported that when a new supersized Airbus A380 underwent mandatory evacuation tests in 2006, thirty-three of the 873 evacuating volunteers got hurt. While the evacuation was considered a success, one volunteer suffered a broken leg, while the remaining 32 received slide burns. Such accidents are common. In her article, Ripley provided tips on how to make it down the airplane slide without injury.[81] Another improvement to airplane evacuations is the requirement by the Federal Aviation Administration for planes to demonstrate an evacuation time of 90 seconds with half the emergency exits blocked for each type of airplane in their fleet. According to studies, 90 seconds is the time needed to evacuate before the plane starts burning, before there can be a very large fire or explosions, or before fumes fill the cabin.[51][80] Changes such as using new materials for seat fabric and insulation has given between 40 and 60 additional seconds to people on board to evacuate before the cabin gets filled with fire and potential deadly fumes.[51] Other improvements through the years include the use of properly rated seatbelts, impact resistant seat frames, and airplane wings and engines designed to shear off to absorb impact forces. [80] As the result of the accidents due to wind shear and other weather disturbances, most notably the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993.[52] Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler weather radar units on the ground (NEXRAD).[82] The installation of high-resolution Terminal Doppler Weather Radar stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions.[83] Air safety investigators are trained and authorized to investigate aviation accidents and incidents: to research, analyse, and report their conclusions. They may be specialized in flight operations, training, aircraft structures, air traffic control, flight recorders or human factors. They are employed by government organizations responsible for aviation safety, manufacturers or unions, though only government organizations have statutory powers to investigate. The safety improvement initiatives are aviation safety partnerships between regulators, manufacturers, operators, professional unions, research organizations, and international aviation organizations to further enhance safety.[84] Some major safety initiatives worldwide are: Since pilot error accounts for between one-third and 60% of aviation accidents, advances in automation and technology could replace some or all of the duties of the aircraft pilots. Automation since the 1980s has already eliminated the need for flight engineers. In complex situations with severely degraded systems, the problem-solving and judgment capability of humans is challenging to achieve with automated systems, for example the catastrophic engine failures experienced by United Airlines Flight 232 and Qantas Flight 32.[87] However, with more accurate software modeling of aeronautic factors, test planes have been successfully flown in these conditions.[88] While the accident rate is very low, to ensure they do not rise with the air transport growth, experts recommend creating a robust culture of collecting information from employees without blame.[89] Advancements in satellite navigation, digital flight data, and instrument flight procedure design have significantly contributed to reducing controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) incidents. Implementation of WAAS/LPV and RNP approaches provides improved vertical guidance, while PBN-based helicopter procedures enhance safety during low-visibility and low-altitude operations.[90]"}

An aviation incident is any operating event that compromises safety but does not escalate into an aviation accident. Preventing both accidents and incidents is the primary goal of aviation safety. Adverse weather conditions, including turbulence, thunderstorms, icing, and low visibility, have historically been major contributing factors in aviation accidents and incidents worldwide.[1] According to Annex 13 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, an aviation accident is an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft, which takes place from the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until all such persons have disembarked, and in which (a) a person is fatally or seriously injured, (b) the aircraft sustains significant damage or structural failure, or (c) the aircraft goes missing or becomes completely inaccessible.[2] Annex 13 defines an aviation incident as an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operation.[2] A hull loss occurs if an aircraft is damaged beyond repair, is lost, or becomes completely inaccessible.[3] One of the earliest recorded aviation accidents occurred on May 10, 1785, when a hot air balloon crashed in Tullamore, County Offaly, Ireland. The resulting fire seriously damaged the town, destroying over 130 homes.[4] The first accident involving a powered aircraft occurred on September 17, 1908, when a Wright Model A crashed at Fort Myer, Virginia, USA. The pilot and co-inventor, Orville Wright, was injured, and the passenger, Signal Corps Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge, was killed.[5] The first aircraft accident in which 200 or more people died occurred on March 3, 1974, when 346 died in the crash of Turkish Airlines Flight 981. As of July 2025[update], there have been a total of 34 aviation incidents in which 200 or more people have died. The period from 1958 to 1968 saw tremendous growth in aviation. Improvements in aviation safety and accident investigation procedures were rapidly advancing. In 1963, the Civil Aeronautics Board, under the leadership of then Deputy Director Bobbie R. Allen, established the National Aircraft Accident Investigation School in Oklahoma City. The ICAO's third accident investigation division meeting, held in Montreal, Canada, in January 1965, laid the foundation for accident investigations throughout the world. The proposals were presented by the Director of the Civil Aeronautics Board Bureau of Safety, Bobbie R. Allen, who headed the U.S. delegation. The U.S. formally adopted the proposals at the White House on December 1, 1965.[6] The top 10 countries with the highest number of fatal civil airliner accidents from 1945 to 2021 are the United States, Russia, Canada, Brazil, Colombia, United Kingdom, France, Indonesia, Mexico, and India.[7] The United Kingdom is noted to have the highest number of air crashes in Europe, with a total of 110 air crashes within the time period, and Indonesia is the highest in Asia at 104, followed by India at 95.[7] The most fatalities on board a single aircraft are the 520 fatalities of the 1985 Japan Air Lines Flight 123 accident. The largest loss of life in a single aviation accident are the 583 fatalities of the 1977 Tenerife airport disaster, in which two Boeing 747s collided. The largest loss of life overall in a collective incident are the 2,996 fatalities in the coordinated terrorist destruction of airplanes and occupied buildings in the 2001 September 11 attacks; the first plane to be hijacked and crashed as part of the attack, American Airlines Flight 11, was alone responsible for an estimated 1,700 fatalities in total, making it the single deadliest aviation disaster in history. The deadliest aviation-related disaster regarding fatalities both on board the aircraft and casualties on the ground, was the destruction of the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001. On that morning, four commercial jet airliners on transcontinental flights from East Coast airports to California were hijacked after takeoff. The four hijacked aircraft were subsequently crashed in a series of four coordinated suicide attacks against major American landmarks by 19 Islamist terrorists affiliated with Al-Qaeda. American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, both regularly scheduled domestic transcontinental flights from Boston to Los Angeles, were hijacked by five men each, with the assigned pilot hijacker taking control of the flight, before being intentionally crashed into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center, respectively, destroying both buildings in less than two hours. The World Trade Center crashes killed 2,753. As both planes were carrying a combined total of 157 occupants, the vast majority of fatalities were the occupants of the two towers and the emergency personnel responding to the disaster. In addition, 184 were killed by the impact of American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, causing severe damage and partial destruction to the building's west side. The crash of United Airlines Flight 93 into a field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, which occurred as passengers attempted to retake control of the aircraft from the hijackers, killed all 40 passengers and crew aboard the aircraft. This brought the total number of casualties of the September 11 attacks to 2,996 (including the 19 terrorist hijackers). As deliberate terrorist acts, the 9/11 crashes were not classified as accidents, but as mass-killing. The events were treated by the member nations of NATO as an act of war and terrorism. The war on terror was subsequently launched by NATO in response to the attacks, eventually leading to the death of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who orchestrated the September 11 attacks. The Tenerife airport disaster on March 27, 1977, remains the accident with the highest number of airliner passenger fatalities. 583 people died when a KLM Boeing 747 attempted to take off and collided with a taxiing Pan Am 747 at Los Rodeos Airport on the Canary Island of Tenerife, Spain. All 234 passengers and 14 crew of the KLM aircraft died and 335 of the 396 passengers and crew of the Pan Am aircraft died. Pilot error was the primary cause; the KLM captain mistakenly believed he had received air traffic control clearance and initiated takeoff.[8][9] Other contributing factors were a terrorist incident at Gran Canaria Airport that had caused many flights to be diverted to Los Rodeos, a small airport not well equipped to handle aircraft of such size, dense fog, poor radio phraseology, and controller distraction. The KLM flight crew could not see the Pan Am aircraft on the runway until immediately before the collision.[10] The accident had a lasting influence on the industry, particularly in the area of communication. An increased emphasis was placed on using standardized phraseology in air traffic control (ATC) communication by both controllers and pilots alike. \"Cockpit Resource Management\" has also been incorporated into flight crew training. The captain is no longer considered infallible, and combined crew input is encouraged during aircraft operations.[11] The crash of Japan Air Lines Flight 123 on August 12, 1985, has the highest number of fatalities for any single-aircraft accident:[12] 520 people died aboard a Boeing 747. The aircraft experienced explosive decompression due to an improperly repaired aft pressure bulkhead, leading to the destruction of most of its vertical stabilizer and severing all hydraulic lines, rendering the 747 nearly uncontrollable.[13] Pilots were able to keep the plane flying for 32 minutes after the mechanical failure before crashing into a mountain. All 15 crew members and 505 of the 509 passengers aboard died.[14] Japanese military personnel inaccurately assumed, during a helicopter flyover of the impact site, that there were no survivors. Rescue operations were delayed until the following morning. Medical providers involved in rescue and analysis operations determined that several passengers likely survived the impact and probably would have survived the incident had rescue operations not been delayed. Four passengers survived the incident in its entirety, meaning that they were alive when discharged from the hospital.[14] Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907 In over one hundred years of implementation, aviation safety has improved considerably. In modern times, two major manufacturers still produce heavy passenger aircraft for the civilian market: Boeing in the United States, and the European company Airbus. Both of these manufacturers place a huge emphasis on the use of aviation safety equipment, now a billion-dollar industry in its own right; safety is a key selling point for these companies, as they recognize that a poor safety record in the aviation industry is a threat to corporate survival. Some major safety devices now required in commercial aircraft are: Measured on a passenger-distance calculation, air travel is the safest form of transportation available: Figures mentioned are the ones shared by the air industry when quoting air safety statistics. A typical statement, e.g., by the BBC: \"UK airline operations are among the safest anywhere. When compared against all other modes of transport on a fatality per mile basis, air transport is the safest – six times safer than travelling by car and twice as safe as rail.\"[51] When measured by fatalities per person transported, however, buses are the safest form of transportation. The number of air travel fatalities per person are surpassed only by bicycles and motorcycles. This statistic is used by the insurance industry when calculating insurance rates for air travel.[52] For every billion kilometers traveled, trains have a fatality rate that is 12 times higher than that of air travel, and the fatality rate for automobiles is 62 times greater than for air travel. By contrast, for every billion journeys taken, buses are the safest form of transportation; using this measure, air travel is three times more dangerous than car transportation, and almost 30 times more dangerous than travelling by bus.[53] A 2007 study by Popular Mechanics magazine found that passengers sitting at the back of an aeroplane are 40% more likely to survive a crash than those sitting at the front. The article quotes Boeing, the FAA, and a website on aircraft safety, all of which claim that there is no \"safest\" seat. The study examined 20 crashes, not taking into account the developments in safety after those accidents.[54] However, a flight data recorder is usually mounted in the aircraft's empennage (tail section) where it is more likely to survive a severe crash. Between 1983 and 2000, the survival rate for people in U.S. plane crashes was greater than 95 percent.[55] In an effort to prevent incidents such as the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, a new standard has been issued requiring all commercial aircraft to report their position every 15 minutes to air traffic controllers regardless of the country of origin. Introduced in 2016 by the ICAO, the regulation has no initial requirement for any new aircraft equipment to be fitted. The standard is part of a long-term plan, called the Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System (GADSS), which will require new aircraft to be equipped with data broadcast systems that are in constant contact with air traffic controllers.[56] The GADSS is similar to the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) used for maritime safety.[57] The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) collects voluntarily submitted aviation safety incident/situation reports from pilots, controllers and others. The ASRS uses reports to identify system deficiencies, issue alert messages, and produce two publications, CALLBACK, and ASRS Directline. The collected information is made available to the public, and is used by the FAA, NASA and other organizations working in research and flight safety.[58] The Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives (B3A),[59] formerly known as the Aircraft Crashes Record Office (ACRO), a non-government organization based in Geneva, Switzerland, compiles statistics on aviation accidents of aircraft capable of carrying more than six passengers, excluding helicopters, balloons, and combat aircraft. ACRO only considers crashes in which the aircraft has suffered such damage that it is removed from service, which will further reduce the statistics for incidents and fatalities compared to some other data. The total fatalities due to aviation accidents since 1970 are 83,772. The total number of incidents are 11,164.[60] According to ACRO, recent years have been considerably safer for aviation, with fewer than 170 incidents every year between 2009 and 2017, compared to as many as 226 as recently as 1998.[61] The annual fatalities figure is less than 1,000 for ten of the fourteen years between 2007 and 2020, the year 2017 experiencing the lowest number of fatalities, at 399, since the end of World War II.[62] 2014 included the disappearance of flight MH370 over the Indian Ocean and the shootdown of flight MH17 as part of the war in Donbas. The total number of fatalities in 2014 was 869 more than in 2013. Deaths and incidents in the world per year according to ACRO and Bureau of Aircraft Accident Archives data, as of January 1, 2019[update]: (Data have significantly changed since November 2015 after a major upgrade to the death rate and crash rate web pages.[65][66] This may reflect a change between a static and dynamic web page, where data were made to be automatically updated based on the incidents in their archives.)  The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is tasked by Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of February 20, 2008, to provide an annual review of aviation safety. The Annual Safety Review presents statistics on European and worldwide civil aviation safety. Statistics are grouped according to type of operation, for instance, commercial air transport, and aircraft category, such as aeroplanes, helicopters, gliders, etc. The Agency has access to accident and statistical information collected by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).[67] States are required, according to ICAO Annex 13, on Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation, to report to ICAO information, on accidents and serious incidents to aircraft with a maximum certificated take-off mass (MTOM) over 2250 kg. Therefore, most statistics in this review concern aircraft above this mass. In addition to the ICAO data, a request was made to the EASA Member States to obtain light aircraft accident data. Furthermore, data on the operation of aircraft for commercial air transport were obtained from both ICAO and the NLR Air Transport Safety Institute.[68] Annex 13 of the Chicago Convention provides the international Standards And Recommended Practices that form the basis for air accident and incident investigations by signatory countries, as well as reporting and preventive measures.[69] The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is specifically focused on preventing accidents, rather than determining liability. In Australia, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau is the federal government body responsible for investigating transport-related accidents and incidents, covering air, sea, and rail travel. Formerly an agency of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in 2010, in the interests of keeping its independence it became a stand-alone agency.[70] In Brazil, the Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA) was established under the auspices of the Aeronautical Accident Investigation and Prevention Center, a Military Organization of the Brazilian Air Force (FAB). The organization is responsible for the activities of aircraft accident prevention, and investigation of civil and military aviation occurrences. Formed in 1971, and in accordance with international standards, CENIPA represented a new philosophy: investigations are conducted with the sole purpose of promoting the \"prevention of aeronautical accidents\".[71] In Canada, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB), is an independent agency responsible for the advancement of transportation safety through the investigation and reporting of accident and incident occurrences in all prevalent Canadian modes of transportation – marine, air, rail and pipeline.[72] In China, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) is solely responsible for all air investigations and safety inside the country after the split from the formal CAAC Airlines.[73] In Ethiopia, the Civil Aviation Accident Prevention and Investigation Bureau of the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority (ECAA), which is an agency of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, conducts aircraft accident investigations in Ethiopia or involving Ethiopian aircraft.[74] In France, the agency responsible for investigation of civilian air crashes is the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA). Its purpose is to establish the circumstances and causes of the accident and to make recommendations for their future avoidance.[75] In Germany, the agency for investigating air crashes is the Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigation (BFU). It is an agency of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure.[76] The focus of the BFU is to improve safety by determining the causes of accidents and serious incidents and making safety recommendations to prevent recurrence.[76] The Air Accident Investigation Authority (AAIA) is responsible for investigating civil aviation accidents in Hong Kong, as well as those in other territories involving a Hong Kong-registered aircraft. It is led by Darren Straker, Chief Inspector of Accidents, and headquartered at Hong Kong International Airport. AAIA was established in 2018 in response to an ICAO directive instructing that member states maintain air accident investigation authorities that are independent of civil aviation authorities and related entities. Prior to 2018, accident investigation duties were held by the Civil Aviation Department's Flight Standards & Airworthiness Division and Accident Investigation Division.[77][78] Until May 30, 2012, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation investigated incidents involving aircraft. Since then, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has taken over investigation responsibilities.[79] In Indonesia, the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC; Indonesian: Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi, KNKT) is responsible for the investigation of incidents and accidents, including air accidents. Its aim is the improvement of transportation safety, not just aviation, in Indonesia. Created in 1999 in Italy, the Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Volo (ANSV), has two main tasks: conducting technical investigations for civil aviation aircraft accidents and incidents, while issuing safety recommendations as appropriate; and conducting studies and surveys aimed at increasing flight safety. The organization is also responsible for establishing and maintaining the \"voluntary reporting system\". Although not under the supervision of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, the ANSV is a public authority under the oversight of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of Italy.[80] The Japan Transport Safety Board investigates aviation accidents and incidents. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission investigated aviation accidents and incidents in Japan until October 1, 2001, when the Aircraft and Railway Accidents Investigation Commission (ARAIC) replaced it,[81] and the ARAIC did this function until October 1, 2008, when it merged into the JTSB.[82] Established in 2016, the Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) Malaysia is the main investigation body for aircraft accident/incident. Separate from Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) and Malaysian Aviation Commission (MAVCOM) that is the national aviation authority and commission that oversee aviation economy respectively. The AAIB operates from the ministry of transport headquarters in Putrajaya, and its black box laboratory situated in STRIDE, the ministry of defenses research institute. AAIB Malaysia is teamed by civilians and seconded Royal Malaysian Airforce senior officer and a group of pool investigators from Malaysia Institute of Aviation Technology In Mexico, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) investigates aviation accidents.[83] In the Netherlands, the Dutch Safety Board (Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid) is responsible for the investigation of incidents and accidents, including air accidents. Its aim is the improvement of safety in the Netherlands. Its main focus is on those situations in which civilians are dependent on the government, companies or organizations for their safety. The Board solely investigates when incidents or accidents occur and aims to draw lessons from the results of these investigations. The Safety Board is objective, impartial and independent in its judgment. The Board will always be critical towards all parties concerned.[84] In New Zealand, the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) is responsible for the investigation of air accidents.[85] \"The Commission's purpose, as set out in its Act, is to determine the circumstances and causes of aviation, rail and maritime accidents, and incidents, with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future, rather than to ascribe blame to any person.\"[86] The TAIC investigates with accordance with annex 13 of the ICAO[87] and specific New Zealand legislation.[88] In Poland, State Commission on Aircraft Accidents Investigation (Polish: Państwowa Komisja Badania Wypadków Lotniczych, PKBWL) is responsible for investigating all civil aviation accidents and incidents occurring in the country. Headquartered in Warsaw, the commission is a division of the Ministry of Infrastructure. As of November 2022, the head of the PKBWL is Bogusław Trela. In Russia, the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC, MAK according to the original Russian name) is an executive body overseeing the use and management of civil aviation in the Commonwealth of Independent States. This organization investigates air accidents in the former USSR area under the umbrella of the Air Accident Investigation Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee.[89] There are active discussion to dismantling the committee, and in 2020, Armenia and Russia has signed on a joint agreement establishing the International Bureau for investigating aviation accidents and serious incidents (In Russian: Международное бюро по расследованию авиационных происшествий и серьезных инцидентов), designed to replace the committee and to act as upper body for investigation of aviation incidents and, subordinate to the Eurasian Union. The new body has been assigned duties to investigate serious accidents and incidents in accordance with the requirements of ICAO documents, ensuring independent investigation of accidents, cooperation and interaction between the parties in relation to investigating aircraft accidents, development and use of common rules and procedures for investigating aircraft accidents. In Taiwan, the Taiwan Transportation Safety Board (TTSB) is the independent government agency that is responsible for major transportation accident investigations. TTSB's predecessor was ASC, which was established in 1998. TTSB is under the administration of the Executive Yuan and independent from Civil Aviation Administration. The TTSB consisted of five to seven board members, including a chairman and a vice chairman, appointed by the Premier. The managing director of TTSB manages the day-to-day function of the organization, including accident investigations.[90] In the United Kingdom, the agency responsible for investigation of civilian air crashes is the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) of the Department for Transport. Its purpose is to establish the circumstances and causes of the accident and to make recommendations for their future avoidance.[91] United States civil aviation incidents are investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). NTSB officials piece together evidence from the crash site to determine likely cause, or causes. The NTSB also investigates overseas incidents involving US-registered aircraft, in collaboration with local investigative authorities, especially when significant loss of American lives occurs, or when the involved aircraft is American-built.[92] In Venezuela, the organization tasked with investigating aviation accidents is the Ministry of Aquatic and Air Transport, more specifically the Directorate General for the Prevention and Investigation of Aeronautical Accidents. Out of respect for the deceased and injured, airlines commonly retire the flight number associated with a fatal crash.[93] For example, following the shootdown of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the flight number was changed to MH19. Japan Airlines stopped using the flight number 350 after a fatal plane crash in Tokyo Bay.[94] TransAsia Airways retired the flight number 235 and changed it to 2353 after a plane crash in 2015 that left 15 survivors and Air India retired 171 and 172 after the crash of Air India Flight 171. However, that is not always the case.[95] For example, China Southern Airlines and FedEx Express continued using the flight number 3456 and 14 respectively even after China Southern Airlines had a fatal accident in 1997 and a FedEx Express aircraft crashed on landing a month later. Turkish Airlines also keeps using the flight numbers 981[96] and 1951[97] despite flights under those flight numbers having fatal accidents in 1974 and 2009 respectively. Similarly, Japan Airlines and Singapore Airlines continued using the flight number 516 and 321 respectively, even after the Japan Airlines flight was involved in a collision in 2024 while the Singapore Airlines flight encountered severe turbulence and caused one death a few months later."}

Avgas is distinguished from conventional gasoline (petrol) used in motor vehicles, which is termed mogas (motor gasoline) in an aviation context. Unlike motor gasoline, which has been formulated without lead since the 1970s to allow the use of catalytic converters for pollution reduction, the most commonly used grades of avgas still contain tetraethyl lead, a toxic lead-containing additive used to aid in lubrication of the engine, increase octane rating, and prevent engine knocking (spark-knock). There are ongoing efforts to reduce or eliminate the use of lead in aviation gasoline. Kerosene-based jet fuel is formulated to suit the requirements of turbine engines which have no octane requirement and operate over a much wider flight envelope than piston engines. Kerosene is also used by most diesel piston engines developed for aviation use, such as those by SMA Engines, Austro Engine, and Thielert. The main petroleum component used in blending avgas is alkylate, which is a mixture of various isooctanes. Some refineries also use reformate. All grades of avgas that meet CAN 2–3[further explanation needed], 25-M82[further explanation needed] have a density of 6.01 pounds per US gallon (720 g/L) at 15 °C (59 °F). (6 lb/U.S. gal is commonly used in America for weight and balance computation.)[1] Density increases to 6.41 pounds per US gallon (768 g/L) at −40 °C (−40 °F), and decreases by about 0.1% per 1 °C (1.8 °F) increase in temperature.[2][3] Avgas has an emission coefficient (or factor) of 18.355 pounds per US gallon (2.1994 kg/L) of CO2[4][5] or about 3.07 units of weight CO2 produced per unit weight of fuel used. Avgas is less volatile, with a Reid vapor pressure range of 5.5 to 7 psi, than automotive gasoline, with a range of 8 to 14 psi. A minimum limit ensures adequate volatility for engine starting. The upper limits are related to atmospheric pressure at sea level, 14.7 psi, for motor vehicles and ambient pressure at 22,000 ft, 6.25 psi, for aircraft. The lower avgas volatility reduces the chance of vapor lock in fuel lines at altitudes up to 22,000 ft.[6] The particular mixtures in use today are the same as when they were first developed in the 1940s, and were used in airline and military aero engines with high levels of supercharging; notably the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine used in the Spitfire and Hurricane fighters, Mosquito fighter-bomber and Lancaster heavy bomber (the Merlin II and later versions required 100-octane fuel), as well as the liquid-cooled Allison V-1710 engine, and air-cooled radial engines from Pratt & Whitney, Wright, and other manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic. The high octane ratings were traditionally achieved by the addition of tetraethyllead, a highly toxic substance that was phased out of automotive use in most countries in the late 20th century. Leaded avgas is currently available in several grades with differing maximum lead concentrations. (Unleaded avgas is also available.) Because tetraethyllead is a toxic additive, the minimum amount needed to bring the fuel to the required octane rating is used; actual concentrations are often lower than the permissible maximum.[citation needed] Historically, many post-WWII developed, low-powered 4- and 6-cylinder piston aircraft engines were designed to use leaded fuels; an unleaded replacement fuel is being developed and certified for these engines. Some reciprocating-engine aircraft still require leaded fuels, but some do not, and some can burn unleaded gasoline if a special oil additive is used. The annual US usage of avgas was 186 million US gallons (700,000 m3) in 2008, and was approximately 0.14% of the motor gasoline consumption. From 1983 through 2008, US usage of avgas declined consistently by approximately 7.5 million US gallons (28,000 m3) each year.[7] As of 2024, the annual US usage of avgas was 180 million US gallons (680,000 m3),[8] most of which contained lead,[9] and 170,000 aircraft in the US used leaded avgas.[9] In Europe, avgas remains the most common piston-engine fuel. High prices have encouraged efforts to convert to diesel engines burning jet fuel, which is more readily available, less expensive, and has advantages for aviation use.[10] Grades of avgas are identified by two numbers associated with its Motor Octane Number (MON).[11] The first number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to \"aviation lean\" standards, which is similar to the anti-knock index or \"pump rating\" given to automotive gasoline in the US. The second number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to the \"aviation rich\" standard, which tries to simulate a supercharged condition with a rich mixture, elevated temperatures, and a high manifold pressure. For example, 100/130 avgas has an octane rating of 100 at the lean settings usually used for cruising and 130 at the rich settings used for take-off and other full-power conditions.[12] Antiknock agents such as tetraethyl lead (TEL) help to control detonation and provide lubrication. One gram of TEL contains 640.6 milligrams of lead.  100LL (pronounced \"one hundred low lead\") may contain a maximum of one-half the tetraethyllead allowed in 100/130 (green) avgas.[16][39] Some of the lower-powered (100–150 horsepower or 75–112 kilowatts) aviation engines that were developed in the late 1990s are designed to run on unleaded fuel and on 100LL, an example being the Rotax 912.[20] Automotive gasoline—known as mogas or autogas among aviators—that does not contain ethanol may be used in certified aircraft that have a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for automotive gasoline, as well as in experimental aircraft and ultralight aircraft Some oxygenates other than ethanol are approved, but these STC's prohibit ethanol-laced gasolines. Ethanol-treated gasoline is susceptible to phase-separation which is very possible due to the altitude/temperature changes light airplanes undergo in ordinary flight. This ethanol-treated fuel can flood the fuel system with water which can cause in-flight engine failure. Additionally, the phase-separated fuel can leave remaining portions that do not meet octane requirements due to the loss of the ethanol in the water-absorption process. Further, the ethanol can attack materials in aircraft construction which pre-date \"gasohol\" fuels. Most of these applicable aircraft have low-compression engines which were originally certified to run on 80/87 avgas and require only \"regular\" 87 anti-knock index automotive gasoline. Examples include the popular Cessna 172 Skyhawk or Piper Cherokee with the 150 hp (110 kW) variant of the Lycoming O-320. Some aircraft engines were originally certified using a 91/96 avgas and have STC's available to run \"premium\" 91 anti-knock index (AKI) automotive gasoline. Examples include some Cherokees with the 160 hp (120 kW) Lycoming O-320 or 180 hp (130 kW) O-360, or the Cessna 152 with the O-235. The AKI rating of typical automotive fuel might not directly correspond to the 91/96 avgas used to certify engines, as motor vehicle pumps in the US use the so-called \"(R + M)/2\" averaged motor vehicle octane rating system as posted on gas station pumps. Sensitivity is roughly 8–10 points, meaning that a 91 AKI fuel might have a MON of as low as 86. The extensive testing process required to obtain an STC for the engine/airframe combination helps ensure that, for those eligible aircraft, 91 AKI fuel provides sufficient detonation margin under normal conditions. Automotive gasoline is not a fully viable replacement for avgas in many aircraft, because many high-performance and/or turbocharged airplane engines have been designed to use 100 octane fuel and modifications are necessary in order to use lower-octane fuel.[40][41] Many general aviation aircraft engines were designed to run on 80/87 octane, roughly the standard (as unleaded fuel only, with the \"{R+M}/2\" 87 octane rating) for North American automobiles today. Direct conversions to run on automotive fuel are fairly common, by supplemental type certificate (STC). However, the alloys used in aviation engine construction are chosen for their durability and synergistic relationship with the protective features of lead, and engine wear in the valves is a potential problem on automotive gasoline conversions. Fortunately, significant history of engines converted to mogas has shown that very few engine problems are caused by automotive gasoline. A larger problem stems from the higher and wider range of allowable vapor pressures found in automotive gasoline; this can pose some risk to aviation users if fuel system design considerations are not taken into account. Automotive gasoline can vaporize in fuel lines, causing a vapor lock (a bubble in the line) or fuel pump cavitation, thereby starving the engine of fuel. This does not constitute an insurmountable obstacle, but merely requires examination of the fuel system, ensuring adequate shielding from high temperatures and maintaining sufficient pressure in the fuel lines. This is the main reason why both the specific engine model as well as the aircraft in which it is installed must be supplementally certified for the conversion. A good example of this is the Piper Cherokee with high-compression 160 or 180 hp (120 or 130 kW) engines. Only later versions of the airframe with different engine cowling and exhaust arrangements are applicable for the automotive fuel STC, and even then require fuel-system modifications. Vapor lock typically occurs in fuel systems where a mechanically-driven fuel pump mounted on the engine draws fuel from a tank mounted lower than the pump. The reduced pressure in the line can cause the more volatile components in automotive gasoline to flash into vapor, forming bubbles in the fuel line and interrupting fuel flow. If an electric boost pump is mounted in the fuel tank to push fuel toward the engine, as is common practice in fuel-injected automobiles, the fuel pressure in the lines is maintained above ambient pressure, preventing bubble formation. Likewise, if the fuel tank is mounted above the engine and fuel flows primarily due to gravity, as in a high-wing airplane, vapor lock cannot occur, using either aviation or automotive fuels. Fuel-injected engines in automobiles also usually have a \"fuel return\" line to send unused fuel back to the tank, which has the benefit of equalizing the fuel's temperature throughout the system, further reducing the chance of vapor lock developing. In addition to vapor locking potential, automotive gasoline does not have the same quality tracking as aviation gasoline. To help solve this problem, the specification for an aviation fuel known as 82UL was developed as essentially automotive gasoline with additional quality tracking and restrictions on permissible additives. This fuel is not currently in production and no refiners have committed to producing it.[14] Rotax allows up to 10% ethanol (similar to E10 fuel for cars) in the fuel for Rotax 912 engines. Light sport aircraft that are specified by the manufacturer to tolerate alcohol in the fuel system can use up to 10% ethanol.[20] Fuel dyes aid ground crew and pilots in identifying and distinguishing the fuel grades[13] and most are specified by ASTM D910 or other standards.[16] Dyes for the fuel are required in some countries.[42] The 100LL phase-out has been called \"one of modern GA's most pressing problems\",[43] because 70% of 100LL aviation fuel is used by the 30% of the aircraft in the general aviation fleet that cannot use any of the existing alternatives.[44][45][46] There are three fundamental issues in using unleaded fuels without serious modification of the airframe/engine: In February 2008, Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) announced that the company is very concerned about future availability of 100LL, and as a result, they would develop a line of diesel engines.[48] In a February 2008 interview, TCM president Rhett Ross indicated belief that the aviation industry will be \"forced out\" of using 100LL in the near future, leaving automotive fuel and jet fuel as the only alternatives. In May 2010, TCM announced that they had licensed development of the SMA SR305 diesel engine.[49][50][51] In November 2008, National Air Transportation Association president Jim Coyne indicated that the environmental impact of aviation is expected to be a big issue over the next few years and will result in the phasing out of 100LL because of its lead content.[52] By May 2012, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA Unleaded Avgas Transition rulemaking committee) had put together a plan in conjunction with industry to replace leaded avgas with an unleaded alternative within 11 years. Given the progress already made on 100SF and G100UL, the replacement time might be shorter than that 2023 estimate. Each candidate fuel must meet a checklist of 12 fuel specification parameters and 4 distribution and storage parameters. The FAA has requested a maximum of US$60M to fund the administration of the changeover.[53][54] In July 2014, nine companies and consortiums submitted proposals to the Piston Aviation Fuels Initiative (PAFI) to assess fuels without tetraethyl lead. Phase one testing is performed at the William J. Hughes Technical Center for a FAA approved industry replacement by 2018.[55] In July 2021, the first commercially-produced unleaded avgas, GAMI's G100UL, was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration through a Supplemental Type Certificate.[56] Lycoming Engines provides a list of engines and fuels that are compatible with unleaded fuel. However, all of their engines require that an oil additive be used when unleaded fuel is used: \"When using the unleaded fuels identified in Table 1, Lycoming oil additive P/N LW-16702, or an equivalent finished product such as Aeroshell 15W-50, must be used.\"[22] Lycoming also notes that the octane rating of the fuel used must also meet the requirements stated in the fuel specification, otherwise engine damage may occur due to detonation. Prior to 2022, Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) indicated that leaded avgas is required in their engines, and not unleaded auto fuels: \"Current aircraft engines feature valve gear components which are designed for compatibility with the leaded ASTM D910 fuels. In such fuels, the lead acts as a lubricant, coating the contact areas between the valve, guide, and seat. The use of unleaded auto fuels with engines designed for leaded fuels can result in excessive exhaust valve seat wear due to the lack of lead with cylinder performance deteriorating to unacceptable levels in under 10 hours.\"[57] In 2022, TCM changed its policy. They have announced a formal application to the FAA to approve the use of UL91 and UL94 in selected engines, stating that \"Continental considers 91UL and 94UL fuel as a transitional step in a long-term strategy to reach a more sustainable aviation\".[58] Hjelmco Oil first introduced unleaded Avgas grades in Europe in 2003, after its success with 80UL.[59] This grade of Avgas is manufactured to meet ASTM D7547.[60] Many common Lycoming engines are certified to run on this particular grade of Avgas,[22] and Cessna has approved the use of this fuel in a large number of their piston fleet.[61] This fuel is also usable in any aircraft in Europe[62] or the United Kingdom[63] where the engine is certified to use it, whether or not the airframe is certified to do so, too. The firm Airworthy AutoGas tested an ethanol-free 93 anti-knock index (AKI) premium auto gas on a Lycoming O-360-A4M in 2013. The fuel is certified under Lycoming Service Instruction 1070 and ASTM D4814.[64] Unleaded 94 Motor octane fuel (UL94) is essentially 100LL without the lead. In March 2009, Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) announced they had tested a 94UL fuel that might be the best replacement for 100LL. This 94UL meets the avgas specification including vapor pressure but has not been completely tested for detonation qualities in all Continental engines or under all conditions. Flight testing has been conducted in an IO-550-B powering a Beechcraft Bonanza and ground testing in Continental O-200, 240, O-470, and O-520 engines. In May 2010, TCM indicated that despite industry skepticism, they are proceeding with 94UL and that certification was expected in mid-2013.[65][66] In June 2010, Lycoming Engines indicated their opposition to 94UL. Company general manager Michael Kraft stated that aircraft owners do not realize how much performance would be lost with 94UL and characterized the decision to pursue 94UL as a mistake that could cost the aviation industry billions in lost business. Lycoming believes the industry should be pursuing 100UL instead. The Lycoming position is supported by aircraft type clubs representing owners of aircraft that would be unable to run on lower octane fuel. In June 2010, clubs such as the American Bonanza Society, the Malibu Mirage Owners and Pilots Association, and the Cirrus Owners and Pilots Association collectively formed the Clean 100 Octane Coalition to represent them on this issue and push for unleaded 100 octane avgas.[67][68][69][70] In November 2015, UL94 was added as a secondary grade of unleaded aviation gasoline to ASTM D7547, which is the specification that governs UL91 unleaded avgas. UL91 is currently being sold in Europe. UL94 meets all of the same specification property limits as 100LL with the exception of a lower motor octane number (94.0 minimum for UL94 vs. 99.6 minimum for 100LL) and a decreased maximum lead content. UL94 is an unleaded fuel, but as with all ASTM International unleaded gasoline specifications, a de minimis amount of unintentionally added lead is permitted.[60] Since May 2016, UL94, now a product of Swift Fuels, is available for sale at dozens of airports in the United States. Swift Fuels has an agreement for distribution in Europe.[71][72][73] UL94 is not intended to be a full replacement for 100LL, but rather is designed to be a drop-in replacement for aircraft with lower-octane-rated engines, such as those that are approved for operation on Grade 80 avgas (or lower), UL91, or mogas. It is estimated that up to 65% of the fleet of current general aviation piston-engine-powered aircraft can operate on UL94 with no modifications to either the engine or airframe. Some aircraft, however, do require a FAA-approved Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) to be purchased to allow for operation on UL94.[72][74][75] UL94 has a minimum Motor octane number (MON, which is the octane rating employed for grading aviation gasoline) of 94.0. 100LL has a minimum MON of 99.6.[16][60] AKI is the octane rating used to grade all U.S. automotive gasoline (typical values at the pump can include 87, 89, 91, and 93), and also the 93UL fuel from Airworthy AutoGas. The minimum AKI of UL94, as sold by Swift Fuels, is 98.0. Concurrent with the addition of UL94 to ASTM D7547, the FAA published Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) HQ-16-05, which states that \"UL94 meets the operating limitations or aircraft and engines approved to operate with grade UL91 avgas,\" meaning that \"Grade UL94 avgas that meets specification D7547 is acceptable to use on those aircraft and engines that are approved to operate with ... grade UL91 avgas that meets specification D7547.\"[76] In August 2016, the FAA revised SAIB HQ-16-05 to include similar wording regarding the acceptability of using UL94 in aircraft and engines that are approved to operate with avgas that has a minimum Motor octane rating of 80 or lower, including Grade 80/87.[77] The publication of the SAIB, especially the August 2016 revision, eliminated the need for many of the UL94 STCs being sold by Swift Fuels, as the majority of the aircraft on the STC's Approved Model List are type-certified to use 80-octane or lower avgas. On April 6, 2017, Lycoming Engines published Service Instruction 1070V, which adds UL94 as an approved grade of fuel for dozens of engine models, 60% of which are carbureted engines. Engines with displacements of 235, 320, 360, and 540 cubic inches make up almost 90% of the models approved for UL94.[22]  Swift Fuels, LLC, has attained approval to produce fuel for testing at its pilot plant in Indiana. Composed of approximately 85% mesitylene and 15% isopentane, the fuel is reportedly scheduled for extensive testing by the FAA to receive certification under the new ASTM D7719 guideline for unleaded 100LL replacement fuels. The company eventually intends to produce the fuel from renewable biomass feedstocks, and aims to produce something competitive in price with 100LL and currently available alternative fuels. Swift Fuels has suggested that the fuel, formerly referred to as 100SF, will be available for \"high performance piston-powered aircraft\" before 2020.[71] John and Mary-Louise Rusek founded Swift Enterprises in 2001 to develop renewable fuels and hydrogen fuel cells. They began testing \"Swift 142\" in 2006[78] and patented several alternatives for non-alcohol based fuels which can be derived from biomass fermentation.[79] Over the next several years, the company sought to build a pilot plant to produce enough fuel for larger-scale testing[80][81] and submitted fuel to the FAA for testing.[82][83][84][85] In 2008, an article by technology writer and aviation enthusiast Robert X. Cringely attracted popular attention to the fuel,[86] as also did a cross-country Swift-Fueled flight by the AOPA's Dave Hirschman.[87] Swift Enterprises' claims that the fuel could eventually be manufactured much more cheaply than 100LL have been debated in the aviation press.[82][88][89][90][91][92][93] The FAA found Swift Fuel to have a motor octane number of 104.4, 96.3% of the energy per unit of mass, and 113% of the energy per unit of volume as 100LL, and to meet most of the ASTM D910 standard for leaded aviation fuel. Following tests in two Lycoming engines, the FAA concluded it performs better than 100LL in detonation testing and will provide a fuel saving of 8% per unit of volume, though it weighs 1 pound per US gallon (120 g/L) more than 100LL. GC–FID testing showed the fuel to be made primarily of two components — one about 85% by weight and the other about 14% by weight.[94][95] Soon afterward, AVweb reported that Continental had begun the process of certifying several of its engines to use the new fuel.[96] From 2009 through 2011, 100SF was approved as a test fuel by ASTM International, allowing the company to pursue certification testing.[97][98] satisfactorily tested by the FAA,[99] tested by Purdue University,[100] and approved under ASTM specification D7719 for high-octane Grade UL102, allowing the company to test more economically in non-experimental aircraft.[101] In 2012, Swift Fuels LLC was formed to bring in oil and gas industry experience, scale up production and bring the fuel to market. By November 2013, the company had built its pilot plant and received approval to produce fuel in it.[102] Its most recent patent, approved in 2013, describes methods by which the fuel can be produced from fermentable biomass.[103] The FAA scheduled UL102 for 2 years of phase 2 testing in its PAFI initiative beginning in the summer of 2016.[104] In February 2010, General Aviation Modifications Inc. (GAMI) announced that it was in the process of developing a 100LL replacement to be called G100UL (\"unleaded\"). This fuel is made by blending existing refinery products and yields detonation margins comparable to 100LL. The new fuel is slightly more dense than 100LL, but has a 3.5% higher thermodynamic output. G100UL is compatible with 100LL and can be mixed with it in aircraft tanks for use.[90][31][105] In demonstrations held in July 2010, G100UL performed better than 100LL that just meets the minimum specification and performed as well as average production 100LL.[106] G100UL was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration by the issuance of a Supplemental Type Certificate at AirVenture in July 2021. The STC was initially only applicable to Lycoming-powered models of the Cessna 172. The company indicated that the retail cost was expected to be 0.60–0.85 US dollars per US gallon higher than 100LL.[56] This was later revised to 1.00 US dollar per US gallon.[31] In 2022, Paul Bertorelli of AVweb reported that the FAA was dragging its feet on broadly certifying G100UL, delaying approval of the fuel for more engines and spending over $80 million on EAGLE to re-start a search for an unleaded fuel when G100UL had been under evaluation for over 10 years.[107] In September 2022, in a surprise announcement, the FAA approved an STC for the use of the fuel for all piston-engined aircraft and engine combinations. In February 2023, GAMI began selling supplemental type certificates to allow aircraft owners to use the fuel when it becomes available.[108][109] In April 2024, GAMI announced that 1 million gallons of G100UL had been produced. Fuel availability in the US was forecast for airports in California, Washington and Oregon by the middle of 2024 and the rest of the country by 2026.[32][31][108][109] In December 2024, shortly after G100UL was made available at selected airports in California, several concerns regarding material compatibility arose, as users reported fuel leaks, paint staining, and paint stripping.[110] In December 2013, Shell Oil announced that they had developed an unleaded 100 octane fuel and will submit it for FAA testing with certification expected within two to three years.[111] The fuel is alkylate-based with an additive package of aromatics. No information has yet been published with regard to its performance, producibility or price. Industry analysts have indicated that it will likely cost as much as or more than existing 100LL.[112] In 2018, LyondellBasell and VP Racing Fuels, an established motorsport fuel manufacturer, announced its intention to participate in developing an unleaded fuel for piston-powered aircraft. As of December 2024, it has reached Phase 4 of testing, according to the FAA.[113] TEL found in leaded avgas and its combustion products are potent neurotoxins that have been shown in scientific research to interfere with brain development in children. Children in residences or childcare facilities in close proximity to airports with moderate to high piston engine aircraft traffic are at especially high risk of high blood lead levels.[114][115][116] The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has noted that exposure to even very low levels of lead contamination has been conclusively linked to loss of IQ in children's brain function tests, thus providing a high degree of motivation to eliminate lead and its compounds from the environment.[117][118] While lead concentrations in the air have declined, scientific studies have demonstrated that children's neurological development is harmed by much lower levels of lead exposure than previously understood. Low level lead exposure has been clearly linked to loss of IQ in performance testing. Even an average IQ loss of 1–2 points in children has a meaningful impact for the nation as a whole, as it would result in an increase in children classified as mentally challenged, as well as a proportional decrease in the number of children considered \"gifted\".[118] On November 16, 2007, the environmental group Friends of the Earth formally petitioned the EPA, asking them to regulate leaded avgas. The EPA responded with a notice of petition for rulemaking.[14] The notice of petition stated: Friends of the Earth has filed a petition with EPA, requesting that EPA find pursuant to section 231 of the Clean Air Act that lead emissions from general aviation aircraft cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare and that EPA propose emissions standards for lead from general aviation aircraft. Alternatively, Friends of the Earth requests that EPA commence a study and investigation of the health and environmental impacts of lead emissions from general aviation aircraft, if EPA believes that insufficient information exists to make such a finding. The petition submitted by Friends of the Earth explains their view that lead emissions from general aviation aircraft endanger the public health and welfare, creating a duty for the EPA to propose emission standards.[119] The public comment period on this petition closed on March 17, 2008.[119] Under a federal court order to set a new standard by October 15, 2008, the EPA cut the acceptable limits for atmospheric lead from the previous standard of 1.5 μg/m3 to 0.15 μg/m3. This was the first change to the standard since 1978 and represents an order of magnitude reduction over previous levels. The new standard requires the 16,000 remaining USA sources of lead, which include lead smelting, airplane fuels, military installations, mining and metal smelting, iron and steel manufacturing, industrial boilers and process heaters, hazardous waste incineration, and production of batteries, to reduce their emissions by October 2011.[117][118][120] The EPA's own studies have shown that to prevent a measurable decrease in IQ for children deemed most vulnerable, the standard needs to be set much lower, to 0.02 μg/m3. The EPA identified avgas as one of the most \"significant sources of lead\".[121][122] At an EPA public consultation held in June 2008 on the new standards, Andy Cebula, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association's executive vice president of government affairs, stated that general aviation plays a valuable role in the USA economy and any changes in lead standards that would change the current composition of avgas would have a \"direct impact on the safety of flight and the very future of light aircraft in this country\".[123] In December 2008, AOPA filed formal comments to the new EPA regulations. AOPA has asked the EPA to account for the cost and the safety issues involved with removing lead from avgas. They cited that the aviation sector employs more than 1.3 million people in the US and has an economic direct and indirect effect that \"exceeds $150 billion annually\". AOPA interprets the new regulations as not affecting general aviation as they are currently written.[124] Publication in the USA Federal Register of an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by the USA EPA occurred in April 2010. The EPA indicated: \"This action will describe the lead inventory related to use of leaded avgas, air quality and exposure information, additional information the Agency is collecting related to the impact of lead emissions from piston-engine aircraft on air quality and will request comments on this information.\"[125][126] Despite assertions in the media that leaded avgas will be eliminated in the US by 2017 at the latest date, the EPA confirmed in July 2010 that there is no phase-out date and that setting one would be an FAA responsibility as the EPA has no authority over avgas. The FAA administrator stated that regulating lead in avgas is an EPA responsibility, resulting in widespread criticism of both organizations for causing confusion and delaying solutions.[127][128][129][130][131] In April 2011 at Sun 'n Fun, Pete Bunce, head of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), and Craig Fuller, president and CEO of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, indicated that they both are confident that leaded avgas will not be eliminated until a suitable replacement is in place. \"There is no reason to believe 100 low-lead will become unavailable in the foreseeable future,\" Fuller stated.[132] Final results from EPA's lead modeling study at the Santa Monica Airport shows off-airport levels below current 150 ng/m3 and possible future 20 ng/m3 levels.[133] Fifteen of 17 airports monitored during a year-long study in the US by the EPA have lead emissions well below the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for lead.[134] Avgas is occasionally used in amateur auto racing cars as its octane rating is higher than automotive gasoline thus allowing the engines to run at higher compression ratios.[citation needed]"}

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) considers it a key element in reducing the environmental impact of aviation.[3] Aviation biofuel is used to decarbonize medium and long-haul air travel. These types of travel generate the most emissions. Synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) refers to any non-petroleum-based fuel designed to replace kerosene jet fuel, which is often, but not always, made from biomass. Biofuels are biomass-derived fuels from plants, animals, or waste; depending on which type of biomass is used, they could lower CO2 emissions by 20–98% compared to conventional jet fuel.[4] The first test flight using blended biofuel was in 2008, and in 2011, blended fuels with 50% biofuels were allowed on commercial flights. In 2023 SAF production was 600 million liters, representing 0.2% of global jet fuel use.[5] By 2024, SAF production was to increase to 1.3 billion liters (1 million tonnes), representing 0.3% of global jet fuel consumption and 11% of global renewable fuel production.[6] This increase came as major US production facilities delayed their ramp-up until 2025, having initially been expected to reach 1.9 billion liters. Aviation biofuel can be produced from plant or animal sources such as Jatropha, algae, tallows, waste oils, palm oil, Babassu, and Camelina (bio-SPK); from solid biomass using pyrolysis processed with a Fischer–Tropsch process (FT-SPK); with an alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) process from waste fermentation; or from synthetic biology through a solar reactor. Small piston engines can be modified to burn ethanol. Sustainable biofuels are an alternative to electrofuels.[7] Sustainable aviation fuel is certified as being sustainable by a third-party organisation.  SAF technology faces significant challenges due to feedstock constraints. The oils and fats known as hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (Hefa), crucial for SAF production, are in limited supply as demand increases. Although advanced e-fuels technology, which combines waste CO2 with clean hydrogen, presents a promising solution, it is still under development and comes with high costs. To overcome these issues, SAF developers are exploring more readily available feedstocks such as woody biomass and agricultural and municipal waste, aiming to produce lower-carbon jet fuel more sustainably and efficiently.[8][9] The first flight using blended biofuel took place in 2008.[10] Virgin Atlantic used it to fly a commercial airliner, using feedstocks such as algae.[11] Airlines representing more than 15% of the industry formed the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group, with support from NGOs such as Natural Resources Defense Council and The Roundtable For Sustainable Biofuels by 2008. They pledged to develop sustainable biofuels for aviation.[12] That year, Boeing was co-chair of the Algal Biomass Organization, joined by air carriers and biofuel technology developer UOP LLC (Honeywell).[13] In 2009, the IATA committed to achieving carbon-neutral growth by 2020, and to halve carbon emissions by 2050.[14] In 2010, Boeing announced a target 1% of global aviation fuels by 2015.[15] By June 2011, the revised Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons (ASTM D7566) allowed commercial airlines to blend up to 50% biofuels with conventional jet fuel.[16] The safety and performance of jet fuel used in passenger flights is certified by ASTM International.[17] Biofuels were approved for commercial use after a multi-year technical review from aircraft makers, engine manufacturers and oil companies.[18] Thereafter some airlines experimented with biofuels on commercial flights.[19] As of July 2020, seven annexes to D7566 were published, including various biofuel types:[20] In December 2011, the FAA awarded US$7.7 million to eight companies to develop drop-in sustainable fuels, especially from alcohols, sugars, biomass, and organic matter such as pyrolysis oils, within its CAAFI and CLEEN programs.[21] Biofuel provider Solena filed for bankruptcy in 2015.[22] By 2015, cultivation of fatty acid methyl esters and alkenones from the algae, Isochrysis, was under research.[23] By 2016, Thomas Brueck of Munich TU was forecasting that algaculture could provide 3–5% of jet fuel needs by 2050.[24] In fall 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization announced plans for multiple measures including the development and deployment of sustainable aviation fuels.[25] Dozens of companies received hundreds of millions in venture capital from 2005 to 2012 to extract fuel oil from algae, some promising competitively-priced fuel by 2012 and production of 1 billion US gal (3.8 million m3) by 2012-2014.[26] By 2017 most companies had disappeared or changed their business plans to focus on other markets.[26] In 2019, 0.1% of fuel was SAF:[27] The International Air Transport Association (IATA) supported the adoption of Sustainable Aviation fuel, aiming in 2019 for 2% share by 2025: 7 million m3 (1.8 billion US gal).[28][10] In early 2021, Boeing's CEO Dave Calhoun said drop-in sustainable aviation fuels are \"the only answer between now and 2050\" to reduce carbon emissions.[30] In May 2021, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) set a goal for the aviation industry to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 with SAF as the key component.[31] The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act introduced the Fueling Aviation's Sustainable Transition (FAST) Grant Program. The program provides $244.5 million in grants for SAF-related \"production, transportation, blending, and storage.\"[32] In November, 2022, sustainable aviation fuels were a topic at COP26.[33] As of 2023, 90% of biofuel was made from oilseed and sugarcane which are grown for this purpose only.[34] Regarding future biofuel use, the European Union requires 6% of all aviation fuel sales to be biofuel by 2035, and 70% of sales to be biofuel by 2050.[citation needed] Jet fuel is a mixture of various hydrocarbons. The mixture is restricted by product requirements, for example, freezing point and smoke point. Jet fuels are sometimes classified as kerosene or naphtha-type. Kerosene-type fuels include Jet A, Jet A-1, JP-5 and JP-8. Naphtha-type jet fuels, sometimes referred to as \"wide-cut\" jet fuel, include Jet B and JP-4. \"Drop-in\" biofuels are biofuels that are interchangeable with conventional fuels. Deriving \"drop-in\" jet fuel from bio-based sources is ASTM approved via two routes. ASTM has found it safe to blend in 50% SPK into regular jet fuels.[35][17] Tests have been done with blending synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) in considerably higher concentrations.[36] Several research initiatives and companies have reported work on technologies intended to produce synthetic hydrocarbons and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). The SUN-to-LIQUID project (2016-2019) was a European Union Horizon 2020-funded research initiative that demonstrated the production of sustainable aviation fuel directly from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The project utilised a solar thermochemical process involving a high-temperature solar reactor to produce synthesis gas (syngas), which was then converted into jet fuel through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. On June 13, 2019, researchers at the IMDEA Energy Institute in Móstoles, Spain successfully demonstrated the complete production chain, marking a significant milestone in solar fuel technology. The project consortium included partners from seven European countries and Switzerland, led by Bauhaus Luftfahrt, and received support from the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation. While the demonstration proved the technical feasibility of producing drop-in aviation fuel from renewable sources without competing for agricultural land, the technology remained at an early stage with challenges related to scaling and economic viability requiring further development.[49][50][51][52] Alder Fuels developed a technology to convert lignocellulosic biomass, including forestry and agricultural residues, into a hydrocarbon-rich intermediate product called \"greencrude\" through pyrolysis. This greencrude can subsequently be processed in conventional petroleum refineries using existing infrastructure to produce drop-in aviation and transportation fuels. The company's process utilises waste biomass feedstocks that do not compete with food production, addressing one of the sustainability concerns associated with first-generation biofuels.[53] Universal Fuel Technologies developed Flexiforming technology, a catalytic process designed to convert various feedstocks, including byproducts from existing renewable fuel production, into sustainable aviation fuel. The technology has feedstock flexibility, allowing for the processing of multiple biomass-derived inputs through a single conversion pathway.[54] Arcadia eFuels developed a power-to-liquid facility at the port of Vordingborg, Denmark, utilising a process that combines water electrolysis powered by renewable electricity with carbon dioxide capture to produce synthetic aviation fuel. The process involves generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, which is then combined with captured CO2 to create synthesis gas (syngas), subsequently converted to jet fuel via Fischer-Tropsch or similar gas-to-liquid processes.[55][56] Small piston engines can be modified to burn ethanol.[57] Swift Fuel, a biofuel alternative to avgas, was approved as a test fuel by ASTM International in December 2009.[58][59] Nitrile-based rubber materials expand in the presence of aromatic compounds found in conventional petroleum fuel. Pure biofuels without petroleum and paraffin-based additives may cause rubber seals and hoses to shrink.[60] Synthetic rubber substitutes that are not adversely affected by biofuels, such as Viton, for seals and hoses are available.[61] The United States Air Force found harmful bacteria and fungi in their biofueled aircraft, and use pasteurization to disinfect them.[62] As of May 2025[update] SAF is generally required to be blended with fossil fuel—because jet fuel needs cycloalkanes and aromatics, which are generally deficient in SAF; as well as the more prevalent in SAF n-alkanes and isoalkanes.[63] In 2019 the International Energy Agency forecast SAF production should grow from 18 to 75 billion litres between 2025 and 2040, representing a 5% to 19% share of aviation fuel.[10] By 2019, fossil jet fuel production cost was $0.3-0.6 per L given a $50–100 crude oil barrel, while aviation biofuel production cost was $0.7-1.6, needing a $110–260 crude oil barrel to break-even.[10] As of 2024, SAF represents just 0.3% of global aviation fuel.[64] As of 2020[update] aviation biofuel was more expensive than fossil jet kerosene,[1] considering aviation taxation and subsidies at that time.[65] As of a 2021 analysis, VFA-SAF break-even cost was $2.50/US gal ($0.66/L).[66] This number was generated considering credits and incentives at the time, such as California's LCFS (Low Carbon Fuel Standard) credits and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Renewable Fuel Standard incentives. Sustainable biofuels do not use food crops, prime agricultural land or fresh water. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is certified by a third-party such as the Roundtable For Sustainable Biofuels.[67] As of 2022, some 450,000 flights had used sustainable fuels as part of the fuel mix, although such fuels were ~3x more expensive than the traditional fossil jet fuel or kerosene.[68] In 2023, SAFs account for less than 0.1% of all aviation fuels consumed.[69] Throughout 2024, Alaska Airlines was the leader among U.S. airlines in SAF implementation, accounting for 0.68% of its fuel usage. Other major airlines including United, Delta and JetBlue used SAF in roughly .3% of fuel.[41] A SAF sustainability certification ensures that the product satisfies criteria focused on environmental, social, and economic \"triple-bottom-line\" considerations. Under many emission regulation schemes, such as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EUTS), a certified SAF product may be exempted from carbon compliance liability costs.[70] This marginally improves SAF's economic competitiveness versus fossil-based fuel.[71] The first reputable body to launch a sustainable biofuel certification system was the European-based Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) NGO.[72] Leading airlines and other signatories to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG) pledged to support RSB as their preferred certification provider.[73][74] Some SAF pathways procured RIN pathways under the United States's renewable fuel standard which can serve as an implicit certification if the RIN is a Q-RIN. As emissions trading schemes and other carbon compliance regimes emerge, certain biofuels are likely to be exempted (\"zero-rated\") by governments from compliance due to their closed-loop nature, if they can demonstrate appropriate credentials. For example, in the EUTS, SAFUG's proposal was accepted[76] that only fuels certified as sustainable by the RSB or similar body would be zero-rated.[77] SAFUG was formed by a group of interested airlines in 2008 under the auspices of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Member airlines represented more than 15% of the industry, and signed a pledge to work towards SAF.[78][79] In addition to SAF certification, the integrity of aviation biofuel producers and their products could be assessed by means such as Richard Branson's Carbon War Room,[80] or the Renewable Jet Fuels initiative.[81] The latter works with companies such as LanzaTech, SG Biofuels, AltAir, Solazyme, and Sapphire.[82][verification needed] Along with her co-authors, Candelaria Bergero of the University of California's Earth System Science Department stated that \"main challenges to scaling up such sustainable fuel production include technology costs and process efficiencies\", and widespread production would undermine food security and land use.[83] By 2019, Virgin Australia had fueled more than 700 flights and flown more than one million kilometers, domestic and international, using Gevo's alcohol-to-jet fuel.[84] Virgin Atlantic was working to regularly use fuel derived from the waste gases of steel mills, with LanzaTech.[85] British Airways wanted to convert household waste into jet fuel with Velocys.[85] United Airlines committed to 900 million US gal (3,400,000 m3) of sustainable aviation fuel for 10 years from Fulcrum BioEnergy (of its 4.1 billion US gal (16,000,000 m3) fuel consumption in 2018), after a $30 million investment in 2015.[85] From 2020, Qantas planned to use a 50/50 blend of SG Preston's biofuel on its Los Angeles-Australia flights. SG Preston also planned to provide fuel to JetBlue over 10 years.[85] At its sites in Singapore, Rotterdam and Porvoo, Finland's Neste expected to improve its renewable fuel production capacity from 2.7 to 3.0 million t (6.0 to 6.6 billion lb) a year by 2020, and to increase its Singapore capacity by 1.3 million t (2.9 billion lb) to reach 4.5 million t (9.9 billion lb) in 2022 by investing €1.4 billion ($1.6 billion).[85] By 2020, International Airlines Group had invested $400 million to convert waste into sustainable aviation fuel with Velocys.[86] United Airlines has expanded SAF use across multiple airports worldwide, including Amsterdam in 2022,[87] San Francisco and London in 2023,[88] and Chicago O'Hare and Los Angeles in 2024.[89] In March 2024, regular use of SAF began in the Northeastern United States at John F. Kennedy International Airport, as part of a new effort by JetBlue.[90] Southwest Airlines began using sustainable jet fuel at Chicago Midway International Airport in October 2024.[91] Fuel supplier Avfuel expanded its SAF offerings in Texas in November 2025 through its fixed-base operator (FBO) partner Million Air at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS). The companies had already partnered earlier in the year to provide SAF at an FBO at the Albany International Airport (ALB) in New York.[92] Plants absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, therefore plant-based biofuels emit only the same amount of greenhouse gases as they had previously absorbed. Biofuel production, processing, and transport, however, emit greenhouse gases, reducing the emissions savings.[2] Biofuels with the most emission savings are those derived from photosynthetic algae (98% savings) although the technology is not developed, and those from non-food crops and forest residues (91–95% savings).[2] Jatropha oil, a non-food oil used as a biofuel, lowers CO2 emissions by 50–80% compared to Jet-A1, a kerosene-based fuel.[93] Jatropha, used for biodiesel, can thrive on marginal land where most plants produce low yields.[94][95] A life cycle assessment on jatropha estimated that biofuels could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 85% if former agro-pastoral land is used, or increase emissions by up to 60% if natural woodland is converted.[96] Palm oil cultivation is constrained by scarce land resources and its expansion to forestland causes biodiversity loss, along with direct and indirect emissions due to land-use change.[2] Neste Corporation's renewable products include a refining residue of food-grade palm oil, the oily waste skimmed from the palm oil mill's wastewater. Other Neste sources are used cooking oil from deep fryers and animal fats.[97] Neste's sustainable aviation fuel is used by Lufthansa;[98] Air France and KLM announced 2030 SAF targets in 2022[99] including multi-year purchase contracts totaling over 2.4 million tonnes of SAF from Neste, TotalEnergies, and DG Fuels.[100] Aviation fuel from wet waste-derived feedstock (\"VFA-SAF\") provides an additional environmental benefit. Wet waste consists of waste from landfills, sludge from wastewater treatment plants, agricultural waste, greases, and fats. Wet waste can be converted to volatile fatty acids (VFA's), which then can be catalytically upgraded to SAF. Wet waste is a low-cost and plentiful feedstock, with the potential to replace 20% of US fossil jet fuel.[66] This lessens the need to grow crops specifically for fuel, which in itself is energy intensive and increases CO2 emissions throughout its life cycle. Wet waste feedstocks for SAF divert waste from landfills. Diversion has the potential to eliminate 17% of US methane emissions across all sectors. VFA-SAF's carbon footprint is 165% lower than fossil aviation fuel.[66] This technology is in its infancy; although start-ups are working to make this a viable solution. Alder Renewables, BioVeritas, and ChainCraft are a few organizations committed to this. NASA has determined that 50% aviation biofuel mixture can cut particulate emissions caused by air traffic by 50–70%.[101] Biofuels do not contain sulfur compounds and thus do not emit sulfur dioxide.[citation needed] While, it may be true that the burning of biofuels do not emit sulfur compounds, some forms of production, such as pyrolysis, can in fact produce sulfur compounds and other pollutants. Some potential pollutants that could be released are hydrogen sulfide and different nitrogen compounds like hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, and nitrogen dioxide.[102] There are other forms of biofuel production that may not have the same emissions.[citation needed] Because of the scaling required to make aviation biofuel mainstream, the impact of land usage is a current hindrance to the growth of the biofuel industry. Potential solutions to this issue have begun to surface. For example, algae farms can produce a lot more biofuel per unit of area than crops.[103] Trials of using algae as biofuel were carried out by Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic as early as 2008, although there is little evidence that using algae is a reasonable source for jet biofuels.[104] By 2015, cultivation of fatty acid methyl esters and alkenones from the algae, Isochrysis, was under research as a possible jet biofuel feedstock.[105] To meet international greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets, the aviation industry is prioritizing Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). In countries with high biomass availability like Brazil, the primary pathways identified for decarbonization are Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ).[106] The use of vegetable oils as a feedstock for aviation fuel has been studied for decades. Dunn (2001) highlighted the potential of these oils as alternative jet fuel sources, which fundamentally underpins the modern HEFA pathway.[107] However, economic viability has historically been a major barrier; early assessments by Lander and Reif (1986) noted that producing jet fuel from alternative sources would require significant capital investment compared to conventional petroleum refining.[108] Current perspectives suggest that to overcome these economic challenges, SAF production should be integrated into biorefineries that also foster the production of renewable chemicals, thereby diversifying revenue streams.[106]"}

In military conflict, the role of fighter aircraft is to establish air superiority of the battlespace. Domination of the airspace above a battlefield permits bombers and attack aircraft to engage in tactical and strategic bombing of enemy targets, and helps prevent the enemy from doing the same. The key performance features of a fighter include not only its firepower but also its high speed and maneuverability relative to the target aircraft. The success or failure of a combatant's efforts to gain air superiority hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots, the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters, and the numbers and performance of those fighters. Many modern fighter aircraft also have secondary capabilities such as ground attack and some types, such as fighter-bombers, are designed from the outset for dual roles. Other fighter designs are highly specialized while still filling the main air superiority role, and these include the interceptor and, historically, the heavy fighter and night fighter. Since World War I, achieving and maintaining air superiority has been considered essential for victory in conventional warfare.[1] Fighters continued to be developed throughout World War I, to deny enemy aircraft and dirigibles the ability to gather information by reconnaissance over the battlefield. Early fighters were very small and lightly armed by later standards, and most were biplanes built with a wooden frame covered with fabric, and a maximum airspeed of about 100 mph (160 km/h). A successful German biplane, the Albatross, however, was built with a plywood shell, rather than fabric, which created a stronger, faster airplane. As control of the airspace over armies became increasingly important, all of the major powers developed fighters to support their military operations. Between the wars, wood was largely replaced in part or whole by metal tubing, and finally aluminum stressed skin structures (monocoque) began to predominate. By World War II, most fighters were all-metal monoplanes armed with batteries of machine guns or cannons and some were capable of speeds approaching 400 mph (640 km/h). Most fighters up to this point had one engine, but a number of twin-engine fighters were built; however they were found to be outmatched against single-engine fighters and were relegated to other tasks, such as night fighters equipped with radar sets. By the end of the war, turbojet engines were replacing piston engines as the means of propulsion, further increasing aircraft speed. Since the weight of the turbojet engine was far less than a piston engine, having two engines was no longer a handicap and one or two were used, depending on requirements. This in turn required the development of ejection seats so the pilot could escape, and G-suits to counter the much greater forces being applied to the pilot during maneuvers. Wings were made thinner and swept back to reduce transonic drag, which required new manufacturing methods to obtain sufficient strength. Skins were no longer sheet metal riveted to a structure, but milled from large slabs of alloy. The sound barrier was broken, and after a few false starts due to required changes in controls, speeds quickly reached Mach 2, past which aircraft cannot maneuver sufficiently to avoid attack. In the 1950s, radar homing missiles were developed, giving fighters the ability to engage aircraft from any aspect (front, sides, or rear), in bad weather, and at longer range.[2] Air-to-air missiles largely replaced guns and rockets in the early 1960s since both were believed unusable at the speeds being attained, however the Vietnam War showed that guns still had a role to play, and most fighters built since then are fitted with cannon (typically between 20 and 30 mm (0.79 and 1.18 in) in caliber) in addition to missiles. Most modern combat aircraft can carry at least a pair of air-to-air missiles. In the 1970s, turbofans replaced turbojets, improving fuel economy enough that the last piston engine support aircraft could be replaced with jets, making multi-role combat aircraft possible. Honeycomb structures began to replace milled structures, and the first composite components began to appear on components subjected to little stress. With the steady improvements in computers, defensive systems have become increasingly efficient. To counter this, stealth technologies have been pursued by the United States, Russia, India and China. The first step was to find ways to reduce the aircraft's reflectivity to radar waves by burying the engines, eliminating sharp corners and diverting any reflections away from the radar sets of opposing forces. Various materials were found to absorb the energy from radar waves, and were incorporated into special finishes that have since found widespread application. Composite structures have become widespread, including major structural components, and have helped to counterbalance the steady increases in aircraft weight—most modern fighters are larger and heavier than World War II medium bombers. Because of the importance of air superiority, since the early days of aerial combat armed forces have constantly competed to develop technologically superior fighters and to deploy these fighters in greater numbers, and fielding a viable fighter fleet consumes a substantial proportion of the defense budgets of modern armed forces.[3] The global combat aircraft market was worth $45.75 billion in 2017 and is projected by Frost & Sullivan at $47.2 billion in 2026: 35% modernization programs and 65% aircraft purchases, dominated by the Lockheed Martin F-35 with 3,000 deliveries over 20 years.[4] A fighter aircraft is primarily designed for air-to-air combat.[5] A given type may be designed for specific combat conditions, and in some cases for additional roles such as air-to-ground fighting. Historically the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force referred to them as \"scouts\" until the early 1920s, while the U.S. Army called them \"pursuit\" aircraft until the late 1940s (using the designation P, as in Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and Bell P-63 Kingcobra). The UK changed to calling them fighters in the 1920s,[6] while the US Army did so in the 1940s.[7] A short-range fighter designed to defend against incoming enemy aircraft is known as an interceptor. Recognized classes of fighter include: Of these, the Fighter-bomber, reconnaissance fighter and strike fighter classes are dual-role, possessing qualities of the fighter alongside some other battlefield role. Some fighter designs may be developed in variants performing other roles entirely, such as ground attack or unarmed reconnaissance. This may be for political or national security reasons, for advertising purposes, or other reasons.[8] The Sopwith Camel and other \"fighting scouts\" of World War I performed a great deal of ground-attack work. In World War II, the USAAF and RAF often favored fighters over dedicated light bombers or dive bombers, and types such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and Hawker Hurricane that were no longer competitive as aerial combat fighters were relegated to ground attack. Several aircraft, such as the F-111 and F-117, have received fighter designations though they had no fighter capability due to political or other reasons. The F-111B variant was originally intended for a fighter role with the U.S. Navy, but it was canceled. This blurring follows the use of fighters from their earliest days for \"attack\" or \"strike\" operations against ground targets by means of strafing or dropping small bombs and incendiaries. Versatile multi role fighter-bombers such as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet are a less expensive option than having a range of specialized aircraft types. Some of the most expensive fighters such as the US Grumman F-14 Tomcat, McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and Russian Sukhoi Su-27 were employed as all-weather interceptors as well as air superiority fighter aircraft, while commonly developing air-to-ground roles late in their careers. An interceptor is generally an aircraft intended to target (or intercept) bombers and so often trades maneuverability for climb rate.[9] As a part of military nomenclature, a letter is often assigned to various types of aircraft to indicate their use, along with a number to indicate the specific aircraft. The letters used to designate a fighter differ in various countries. In the English-speaking world, \"F\" is often now used to indicate a fighter (e.g. Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II or Supermarine Spitfire F.22), though \"P\" used to be used in the US for pursuit (e.g. Curtiss P-40 Warhawk), a translation of the French \"C\" (Dewoitine D.520 C.1) for Chasseur while in Russia \"I\" was used for Istrebitel, or exterminator (Polikarpov I-16). As fighter types have proliferated, the air superiority fighter emerged as a specific role at the pinnacle of speed, maneuverability, and air-to-air weapon systems – able to hold its own against all other fighters and establish its dominance in the skies above the battlefield. The interceptor is a fighter designed specifically to intercept and engage approaching enemy aircraft. There are two general classes of interceptor: relatively lightweight aircraft in the point-defence role, built for fast reaction, high performance and with a short range, and heavier aircraft with more comprehensive avionics and designed to fly at night or in all weathers and to operate over longer ranges. Originating during World War I, by 1929 this class of fighters had become known as the interceptor.[10] The equipment necessary for daytime flight is inadequate when flying at night or in poor visibility. The night fighter was developed during World War I with additional equipment to aid the pilot in flying straight, navigating and finding the target. From modified variants of the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c in 1915, the night fighter has evolved into the highly capable all-weather fighter.[11] The strategic fighter is a fast, heavily armed and long-range type, able to act as an escort fighter protecting bombers, to carry out offensive sorties of its own as a penetration fighter and maintain standing patrols at significant distance from its home base.[12] Bombers are vulnerable due to their low speed, large size and poor maneuvrability. The escort fighter was developed during World War II to come between the bombers and enemy attackers as a protective shield. The primary requirement was for long range, with several heavy fighters given the role. However they too proved unwieldy and vulnerable, so as the war progressed techniques such as drop tanks were developed to extend the range of more nimble conventional fighters. The penetration fighter is typically also fitted for the ground-attack role, and so is able to defend itself while conducting attack sorties. The word \"fighter\" was first used to describe a two-seat aircraft carrying a machine gun (mounted on a pedestal) and its operator as well as the pilot. Although the term was coined in the United Kingdom, the first examples were the French Voisin pushers beginning in 1910, and a Voisin III would be the first to shoot down another aircraft, on 5 October 1914.[13] However at the outbreak of World War I, front-line aircraft were mostly unarmed and used almost exclusively for reconnaissance. On 15 August 1914, Miodrag Tomić encountered an enemy airplane while on a reconnaissance flight over Austria-Hungary which fired at his aircraft with a revolver,[14] so Tomić fired back.[15][16] It was believed to be the first exchange of fire between aircraft.[17] Within weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian aircraft were armed.[14] Another type of military aircraft formed the basis for an effective \"fighter\" in the modern sense of the word. It was based on small fast aircraft developed before the war for air racing such with the Gordon Bennett Cup and Schneider Trophy. The military scout airplane was not expected to carry serious armament, but rather to rely on speed to \"scout\" a location, and return quickly to report, making it a flying horse. British scout aircraft, in this sense, included the Sopwith Tabloid and Bristol Scout. The French and the Germans didn't have an equivalent as they used two seaters for reconnaissance, such as the Morane-Saulnier L, but would later modify pre-war racing aircraft into armed single seaters. It was quickly found that these were of little use since the pilot couldn't record what he saw while also flying, while military leaders usually ignored what the pilots reported. Attempts were made with handheld weapons such as pistols and rifles and even light machine guns, but these were ineffective and cumbersome.[18][full citation needed] The next advance came with the fixed forward-firing machine gun, so that the pilot pointed the entire aircraft at the target and fired the gun, instead of relying on a second gunner. Roland Garros bolted metal deflector plates to the propeller so that it would not shoot itself out of the sky and a number of Morane-Saulnier Ns were modified. The technique proved effective, however the deflected bullets were still highly dangerous.[19] Soon after the commencement of the war, pilots armed themselves with pistols, carbines, grenades, and an assortment of improvised weapons. Many of these proved ineffective as the pilot had to fly his airplane while attempting to aim a handheld weapon and make a difficult deflection shot. The first step in finding a real solution was to mount the weapon on the aircraft, but the propeller remained a problem since the best direction to shoot is straight ahead. Numerous solutions were tried. A second crew member behind the pilot could aim and fire a swivel-mounted machine gun at enemy airplanes; however, this limited the area of coverage chiefly to the rear hemisphere, and effective coordination of the pilot's maneuvering with the gunner's aiming was difficult. This option was chiefly employed as a defensive measure on two-seater reconnaissance aircraft from 1915 on. Both the SPAD S.A and the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.9 added a second crewman ahead of the engine in a pod but this was both hazardous to the second crewman and limited performance. The Sopwith L.R.T.Tr. similarly added a pod on the top wing with no better luck. An alternative was to build a \"pusher\" scout such as the Airco DH.2, with the propeller mounted behind the pilot. The main drawback was that the high drag of a pusher type's tail structure made it slower than a similar \"tractor\" aircraft. A better solution for a single seat scout was to mount the machine gun (rifles and pistols having been dispensed with) to fire forwards but outside the propeller arc. Wing guns were tried but the unreliable weapons available required frequent clearing of jammed rounds and misfires and remained impractical until after the war. Mounting the machine gun over the top wing worked well and was used long after the ideal solution was found. The Nieuport 11 of 1916 used this system with considerable success, however, this placement made aiming and reloading difficult but would continue to be used throughout the war as the weapons used were lighter and had a higher rate of fire than synchronized weapons. The British Foster mounting and several French mountings were specifically designed for this kind of application, fitted with either the Hotchkiss or Lewis Machine gun, which due to their design were unsuitable for synchronizing. The need to arm a tractor scout with a forward-firing gun whose bullets passed through the propeller arc was evident even before the outbreak of war and inventors in both France and Germany devised mechanisms that could time the firing of the individual rounds to avoid hitting the propeller blades. Franz Schneider, a Swiss engineer, had patented such a device in Germany in 1913, but his original work was not followed up. French aircraft designer Raymond Saulnier patented a practical device in April 1914, but trials were unsuccessful because of the propensity of the machine gun employed to hang fire due to unreliable ammunition. In December 1914, French aviator Roland Garros asked Saulnier to install his synchronization gear on Garros' Morane-Saulnier Type L parasol monoplane. Unfortunately the gas-operated Hotchkiss machine gun he was provided had an erratic rate of fire and it was impossible to synchronize it with the propeller. As an interim measure, the propeller blades were fitted with metal wedges to protect them from ricochets. Garros' modified monoplane first flew in March 1915 and he began combat operations soon after. Garros scored three victories in three weeks before he himself was downed on 18 April and his airplane, along with its synchronization gear and propeller was captured by the Germans. Meanwhile, the synchronization gear (called the Stangensteuerung in German, for \"pushrod control system\") devised by the engineers of Anthony Fokker's firm was the first system to enter service. It would usher in what the British called the \"Fokker scourge\" and a period of air superiority for the German forces, making the Fokker Eindecker monoplane a feared name over the Western Front, despite its being an adaptation of an obsolete pre-war French Morane-Saulnier racing airplane, with poor flight characteristics and a by now mediocre performance. The first Eindecker victory came on 1 July 1915, when Leutnant Kurt Wintgens, of Feldflieger Abteilung 6 on the Western Front, downed a Morane-Saulnier Type L. His was one of five Fokker M.5K/MG prototypes for the Eindecker, and was armed with a synchronized aviation version of the Parabellum MG14 machine gun.[20] The success of the Eindecker kicked off a competitive cycle of improvement among the combatants, both sides striving to build ever more capable single-seat fighters. The Albatros D.I and Sopwith Pup of 1916 set the classic pattern followed by fighters for about twenty years. Most were biplanes and only rarely monoplanes or triplanes. The strong box structure of the biplane provided a rigid wing that allowed the accurate control essential for dogfighting. They had a single operator, who flew the aircraft and also controlled its armament. They were armed with one or two Maxim or Vickers machine guns, which were easier to synchronize than other types, firing through the propeller arc. Gun breeches were in front of the pilot, with obvious implications in case of accidents, but jams could be cleared in flight, while aiming was simplified. The use of metal aircraft structures was pioneered before World War I by Breguet but would find its biggest proponent in Anthony Fokker, who used chrome-molybdenum steel tubing for the fuselage structure of all his fighter designs, while the innovative German engineer Hugo Junkers developed two all-metal, single-seat fighter monoplane designs with cantilever wings: the strictly experimental Junkers J 2 private-venture aircraft, made with steel, and some forty examples of the Junkers D.I, made with corrugated duralumin, all based on his experience in creating the pioneering Junkers J 1 all-metal airframe technology demonstration aircraft of late 1915. While Fokker would pursue steel tube fuselages with wooden wings until the late 1930s, and Junkers would focus on corrugated sheet metal, Dornier was the first to build a fighter (the Dornier-Zeppelin D.I) made with pre-stressed sheet aluminum and having cantilevered wings, a form that would replace all others in the 1930s. As collective combat experience grew, the more successful pilots such as Oswald Boelcke, Max Immelmann, and Edward Mannock developed innovative tactical formations and maneuvers to enhance their air units' combat effectiveness. Allied and – before 1918 – German pilots of World War I were not equipped with parachutes, so in-flight fires or structural failures were often fatal. Parachutes were well-developed by 1918 having previously been used by balloonists, and were adopted by the German flying services during the course of that year. The well-known Manfred von Richthofen, the \"Red Baron\", was wearing one when he was killed, but the allied command continued to oppose their use on various grounds.[21][page needed] In April 1917, during a brief period of German aerial supremacy a British pilot's average life expectancy was calculated to average 93 flying hours, or about three weeks of active service.[22][23] More than 50,000 airmen from both sides died during the war.[24] Fighter development stagnated between the wars, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom, where budgets were small. In France, Italy and Russia, where large budgets continued to allow major development, both monoplanes and all metal structures were common. By the end of the 1920s, however, those countries overspent themselves and were overtaken in the 1930s by those powers that hadn't been spending heavily, namely the British, the Americans, the Spanish (in the Spanish civil war) and the Germans. Given limited budgets, air forces were conservative in aircraft design, and biplanes remained popular with pilots for their agility, and remained in service long after they ceased to be competitive. Designs such as the Gloster Gladiator, Fiat CR.42 Falco, and Polikarpov I-15 were common even in the late 1930s, and many were still in service as late as 1942. Up until the mid-1930s, the majority of fighters in the US, the UK, Italy and Russia remained fabric-covered biplanes. Fighter armament eventually began to be mounted inside the wings, outside the arc of the propeller, though most designs retained two synchronized machine guns directly ahead of the pilot, where they were more accurate (that being the strongest part of the structure, reducing the vibration to which the guns were subjected). Shooting with this traditional arrangement was also easier because the guns shot directly ahead in the direction of the aircraft's flight, up to the limit of the guns range; unlike wing-mounted guns which to be effective required to be harmonised, that is, preset to shoot at an angle by ground crews so that their bullets would converge on a target area a set distance ahead of the fighter. Rifle-caliber .30 and .303 in (7.62 and 7.70 mm) calibre guns remained the norm, with larger weapons either being too heavy and cumbersome or deemed unnecessary against such lightly built aircraft. It was not considered unreasonable to use World War I-style armament to counter enemy fighters as there was insufficient air-to-air combat during most of the period to disprove this notion. The rotary engine, popular during World War I, quickly disappeared, its development having reached the point where rotational forces prevented more fuel and air from being delivered to the cylinders, which limited horsepower. They were replaced chiefly by the stationary radial engine though major advances led to inline engines gaining ground with several exceptional engines—including the 1,145 cu in (18,760 cm3) V-12 Curtiss D-12. Aircraft engines increased in power several-fold over the period, going from a typical 180 hp (130 kW) in the 900 kg (2,000 lb) Fokker D.VII of 1918 to 900 hp (670 kW) in the 2,500 kg (5,500 lb) Curtiss P-36 of 1936. The debate between the sleek in-line engines versus the more reliable radial models continued, with naval air forces preferring the radial engines, and land-based forces often choosing inlines. Radial designs did not require a separate (and vulnerable) radiator, but had increased drag. Inline engines often had a better power-to-weight ratio. Some air forces experimented with \"heavy fighters\" (called \"destroyers\" by the Germans). These were larger, usually twin-engined aircraft, sometimes adaptations of light or medium bomber types. Such designs typically had greater internal fuel capacity (thus longer range) and heavier armament than their single-engine counterparts. In combat, they proved vulnerable to more agile single-engine fighters. The primary driver of fighter innovation, right up to the period of rapid re-armament in the late 1930s, were not military budgets, but civilian aircraft racing. Aircraft designed for these races introduced innovations like streamlining and more powerful engines that would find their way into the fighters of World War II. The most significant of these was the Schneider Trophy races, where competition grew so fierce, only national governments could afford to enter. At the very end of the inter-war period in Europe came the Spanish Civil War. This was just the opportunity the German Luftwaffe, Italian Regia Aeronautica, and the Soviet Union's Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily needed to test their latest aircraft. Each party sent numerous aircraft types to support their sides in the conflict. In the dogfights over Spain, the latest Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters did well, as did the Soviet Polikarpov I-16. The later German design was earlier in its design cycle, and had more room for development and the lessons learned led to greatly improved models in World War II. The Russians failed to keep up and despite newer models coming into service, I-16s remaining the most common Soviet front-line fighter into 1942 despite being outclassed by the improved Bf 109s in World War II. For their part, the Italians developed several monoplanes such as the Fiat G.50 Freccia, but being short on funds, were forced to continue operating obsolete Fiat CR.42 Falco biplanes. From the early 1930s the Japanese were at war against both the Chinese Nationalists and the Russians in China, and used the experience to improve both training and aircraft, replacing biplanes with modern cantilever monoplanes and creating a cadre of exceptional pilots. In the United Kingdom, at the behest of Neville Chamberlain (more famous for his 'peace in our time' speech), the entire British aviation industry was retooled, allowing it to change quickly from fabric covered metal framed biplanes to cantilever stressed skin monoplanes in time for the war with Germany, a process that France attempted to emulate, but too late to counter the German invasion. The period of improving the same biplane design over and over was now coming to an end, and the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire started to supplant the Gloster Gladiator and Hawker Fury biplanes but many biplanes remained in front-line service well past the start of World War II. While not a combatant in Spain, they too absorbed many of the lessons in time to use them. The Spanish Civil War also provided an opportunity for updating fighter tactics. One of the innovations was the development of the \"finger-four\" formation by the German pilot Werner Mölders. Each fighter squadron (German: Staffel) was divided into several flights (Schwärme) of four aircraft. Each Schwarm was divided into two Rotten, which was a pair of aircraft. Each Rotte was composed of a leader and a wingman. This flexible formation allowed the pilots to maintain greater situational awareness, and the two Rotten could split up at any time and attack on their own. The finger-four would be widely adopted as the fundamental tactical formation during World War Two, including by the British and later the Americans.[clarification needed] World War II featured fighter combat on a larger scale than any other conflict to date. German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel noted the effect of airpower: \"Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of the air, fights like a savage...\"[25] Throughout the war, fighters performed their conventional role in establishing air superiority through combat with other fighters and through bomber interception, and also often performed roles such as tactical air support and reconnaissance. Fighter design varied widely among combatants. The Japanese and Italians favored lightly armed and armored but highly maneuverable designs such as the Japanese Nakajima Ki-27, Nakajima Ki-43 and Mitsubishi A6M Zero and the Italian Fiat G.50 Freccia and Macchi MC.200. In contrast, designers in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States believed that the increased speed of fighter aircraft would create g-forces unbearable to pilots who attempted maneuvering dogfights typical of the First World War, and their fighters were instead optimized for speed and firepower. In practice, while light, highly maneuverable aircraft did possess some advantages in fighter-versus-fighter combat, those could usually be overcome by sound tactical doctrine, and the design approach of the Italians and Japanese made their fighters ill-suited as interceptors or attack aircraft. During the invasion of Poland and the Battle of France, Luftwaffe fighters—primarily the Messerschmitt Bf 109—held air superiority, and the Luftwaffe played a major role in German victories in these campaigns. During the Battle of Britain, however, British Hurricanes and Spitfires proved roughly equal to Luftwaffe fighters. Additionally Britain's radar-based Dowding system directing fighters onto German attacks and the advantages of fighting above Britain's home territory allowed the RAF to deny Germany air superiority, saving the UK from possible German invasion and dealing the Axis a major defeat early in the Second World War. On the Eastern Front, Soviet fighter forces were overwhelmed during the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa. This was a result of the tactical surprise at the outset of the campaign, the leadership vacuum within the Soviet military left by the Great Purge, and the general inferiority of Soviet designs at the time, such as the obsolescent Polikarpov I-15 biplane and the I-16. More modern Soviet designs, including the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3, LaGG-3 and Yakolev Yak-1, had not yet arrived in numbers and in any case were still inferior to the Messerschmitt Bf 109. As a result, during the early months of these campaigns, Axis air forces destroyed large numbers of Red Air Force aircraft on the ground and in one-sided dogfights. In the later stages on the Eastern Front, Soviet training and leadership improved, as did their equipment. By 1942 Soviet designs such as the Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-5 had performance comparable to the German Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190. Also, significant numbers of British, and later U.S., fighter aircraft were supplied to aid the Soviet war effort as part of Lend-Lease, with the Bell P-39 Airacobra proving particularly effective in the lower-altitude combat typical of the Eastern Front. The Soviets were also helped indirectly by the American and British bombing campaigns, which forced the Luftwaffe to shift many of its fighters away from the Eastern Front in defense against these raids. The Soviets increasingly were able to challenge the Luftwaffe, and while the Luftwaffe maintained a qualitative edge over the Red Air Force for much of the war, the increasing numbers and efficacy of the Soviet Air Force were critical to the Red Army's efforts at turning back and eventually annihilating the Wehrmacht. Meanwhile, air combat on the Western Front had a much different character. Much of this combat focused on the strategic bombing campaigns of the RAF and the USAAF against German industry intended to wear down the Luftwaffe. Axis fighter aircraft focused on defending against Allied bombers while Allied fighters' main role was as bomber escorts. The RAF raided German cities at night, and both sides developed radar-equipped night fighters for these battles. The Americans, in contrast, flew daylight bombing raids into Germany delivering the Combined Bomber Offensive. Unescorted Consolidated B-24 Liberators and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, however, proved unable to fend off German interceptors (primarily Bf 109s and Fw 190s). With the later arrival of long range fighters, particularly the North American P-51 Mustang, American fighters were able to escort far into Germany on daylight raids and by ranging ahead attrited the Luftwaffe to establish control of the skies over Western Europe. By the time of Operation Overlord in June 1944, the Allies had gained near complete air superiority over the Western Front. This cleared the way both for intensified strategic bombing of German cities and industries, and for the tactical bombing of battlefield targets. With the Luftwaffe largely cleared from the skies, Allied fighters increasingly served as ground attack aircraft. Allied fighters, by gaining air superiority over the European battlefield, played a crucial role in the eventual defeat of the Axis, which Reichmarshal Hermann Göring, commander of the German Luftwaffe summed up when he said: \"When I saw Mustangs over Berlin, I knew the jig was up.\"[26] Major air combat during the war in the Pacific began with the entry of the Western Allies following Japan's attack against Pearl Harbor. The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service primarily operated the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service flew the Nakajima Ki-27 and the Nakajima Ki-43, initially enjoying great success, as these fighters generally had better range, maneuverability, speed and climb rates than their Allied counterparts.[27][28] Additionally, Japanese pilots were well trained and many were combat veterans from Japan's campaigns in China. They quickly gained air superiority over the Allies, who at this stage of the war were often disorganized, under-trained and poorly equipped, and Japanese air power contributed significantly to their successes in the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore, the Dutch East Indies and Burma. By mid-1942, the Allies began to regroup and while some Allied aircraft such as the Brewster Buffalo and the P-39 Airacobra were hopelessly outclassed by fighters like Japan's Mitsubishi A6M Zero, others such as the Army's Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and the Navy's Grumman F4F Wildcat possessed attributes such as superior firepower, ruggedness and dive speed, and the Allies soon developed tactics (such as the Thach Weave) to take advantage of these strengths. These changes soon paid dividends, as the Allied ability to deny Japan air superiority was critical to their victories at Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal and New Guinea. In China, the Flying Tigers also used the same tactics with some success, although they were unable to stem the tide of Japanese advances there. By 1943, the Allies began to gain the upper hand in the Pacific Campaign's air campaigns. Several factors contributed to this shift. First, the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and second-generation Allied fighters such as the Grumman F6 Hellcat and later the Vought F4 Corsair, the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and the North American P-51 Mustang, began arriving in numbers. These fighters outperformed Japanese fighters in all respects except maneuverability. Other problems with Japan's fighter aircraft also became apparent as the war progressed, such as their lack of armor and light armament, which had been typical of all pre-war fighters worldwide, but the problem was particularly difficult to rectify on the Japanese designs. This made them inadequate as either bomber-interceptors or ground-attack aircraft, roles Allied fighters were still able to fill. Most importantly, Japan's training program failed to provide enough well-trained pilots to replace losses. In contrast, the Allies improved both the quantity and quality of pilots graduating from their training programs. By mid-1944, Allied fighters had gained air superiority throughout the theater, which would not be contested again during the war. The extent of Allied quantitative and qualitative superiority by this point in the war was demonstrated during the Battle of the Philippine Sea, a lopsided Allied victory in which Japanese fliers were shot down in such numbers and with such ease that American fighter pilots likened it to a great 'turkey shoot'. Late in the war, Japan began to produce new fighters such as the Nakajima Ki-84 and the Kawanishi N1K to replace the Zero, but only in small numbers, and by then Japan lacked the trained pilots or sufficient fuel to mount an effective challenge to Allied attacks. During the closing stages of the war, Japan's fighter arm could not seriously challenge raids over Japan by American Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, and was largely reduced to Kamikaze attacks. Fighter technology advanced rapidly during the Second World War. Piston-engines, which powered the vast majority of World War II fighters, grew more powerful: at the beginning of the war fighters typically had engines producing between 1,000 hp (750 kW) and 1,400 hp (1,000 kW), while by the end of the war many could produce over 2,000 hp (1,500 kW). For example, the Spitfire, one of the few fighters in continuous production throughout the war, was in 1939 powered by a 1,030 hp (770 kW) Merlin II, while variants produced in 1945 were equipped with the 2,035 hp (1,517 kW) Rolls-Royce Griffon 61. Nevertheless, these fighters could only achieve modest increases in top speed due to problems of compressibility created as aircraft and their propellers approached the sound barrier, and it was apparent that propeller-driven aircraft were approaching the limits of their performance. German jet and rocket-powered fighters entered combat in 1944, too late to impact the war's outcome. The same year the Allies' only operational jet fighter, the Gloster Meteor, also entered service. World War II fighters also increasingly featured monocoque construction, which improved their aerodynamic efficiency while adding structural strength. Laminar flow wings, which improved high speed performance, also came into use on fighters such as the P-51 Mustang, while the Messerschmitt Me 262 and the Messerschmitt Me 163 featured swept wings that dramatically reduced drag at high subsonic speeds. Armament also advanced during the war. The rifle-caliber machine guns that were common on prewar fighters could not easily down the more rugged warplanes of the era. Air forces began to replace or supplement them with cannons, which fired explosive shells that could blast a hole in an enemy aircraft – rather than relying on kinetic energy from a solid bullet striking a critical component of the aircraft, such as a fuel line or control cable, or the pilot. Cannons could bring down even heavy bombers with just a few hits, but their slower rate of fire made it difficult to hit fast-moving fighters in a dogfight. Eventually, most fighters mounted cannons, sometimes in combination with machine guns. The British epitomized this shift. Their standard early war fighters mounted eight .303 in (7.7 mm) caliber machine guns, but by mid-war they often featured a combination of machine guns and 20 mm (0.79 in) cannons, and late in the war often only cannons. The Americans, in contrast, had problems producing a cannon design, so instead placed multiple .50 in (12.7 mm) heavy machine guns on their fighters. Fighters were also increasingly fitted with bomb racks and air-to-surface ordnance such as bombs or rockets beneath their wings, and pressed into close air support roles as fighter-bombers. Although they carried less ordnance than light and medium bombers, and generally had a shorter range, they were cheaper to produce and maintain and their maneuverability made it easier for them to hit moving targets such as motorized vehicles. Moreover, if they encountered enemy fighters, their ordnance (which reduced lift and increased drag and therefore decreased performance) could be jettisoned and they could engage enemy fighters, which eliminated the need for fighter escorts that bombers required. Heavily armed fighters such as Germany's Focke-Wulf Fw 190, Britain's Hawker Typhoon and Hawker Tempest, and America's Curtiss P-40, F4U Corsair, P-47 Thunderbolt and P-38 Lightning all excelled as fighter-bombers, and since the Second World War ground attack has become an important secondary capability of many fighters. World War II also saw the first use of airborne radar on fighters. The primary purpose of these radars was to help night fighters locate enemy bombers and fighters. Because of the bulkiness of these radar sets, they could not be carried on conventional single-engined fighters and instead were typically retrofitted to larger heavy fighters or light bombers such as Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Junkers Ju 88, Britain's de Havilland Mosquito and Bristol Beaufighter, and America's Douglas A-20, which then served as night fighters. The Northrop P-61 Black Widow, a purpose-built night fighter, was the only fighter of the war that incorporated radar into its original design. Britain and America cooperated closely in the development of airborne radar, and Germany's radar technology generally lagged slightly behind Anglo-American efforts, while other combatants developed few radar-equipped fighters. A concept originated from German engineer Bernhard J. Schrage in 1943 as a response to the increasing threat posed by Allied heavy bombers, particularly at night. The Schrage Musik system involved mounting upward-facing cannon turrets, typically twin 20mm or 30mm guns, in the belly of German night fighters such as the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and later versions of the Junkers Ju 88. These guns were angled upwards to target the vulnerable underside of enemy bombers. Several prototype fighter programs begun early in 1945 continued on after the war and led to advanced piston-engine fighters that entered production and operational service in 1946. A typical example is the Lavochkin La-9 'Fritz', which was an evolution of the successful wartime Lavochkin La-7 'Fin'. Working through a series of prototypes, the La-120, La-126 and La-130, the Lavochkin design bureau sought to replace the La-7's wooden airframe with a metal one, as well as fit a laminar flow wing to improve maneuver performance, and increased armament. The La-9 entered service in August 1946 and was produced until 1948; it also served as the basis for the development of a long-range escort fighter, the La-11 'Fang', of which nearly 1200 were produced 1947–51. Over the course of the Korean War, however, it became obvious that the day of the piston-engined fighter was coming to a close and that the future would lie with the jet fighter. This period also witnessed experimentation with jet-assisted piston engine aircraft. La-9 derivatives included examples fitted with two underwing auxiliary pulsejet engines (the La-9RD) and a similarly mounted pair of auxiliary ramjet engines (the La-138); however, neither of these entered service. One that did enter service – with the U.S. Navy in March 1945 – was the Ryan FR-1 Fireball; production was halted with the war's end on VJ-Day, with only 66 having been delivered, and the type was withdrawn from service in 1947. The USAAF had ordered its first 13 mixed turboprop-turbojet-powered pre-production prototypes of the Consolidated Vultee XP-81 fighter, but this program was also canceled by VJ Day, with 80% of the engineering work completed. The first rocket-powered aircraft was the Lippisch Ente, which made a successful maiden flight in March 1928.[29] The only pure rocket aircraft ever mass-produced was the Messerschmitt Me 163B Komet in 1944, one of several German World War II projects aimed at developing high speed, point-defense aircraft.[30] Later variants of the Me 262 (C-1a and C-2b) were also fitted with \"mixed-power\" jet/rocket powerplants, while earlier models were fitted with rocket boosters, but were not mass-produced with these modifications.[31] The USSR experimented with a rocket-powered interceptor in the years immediately following World War II, the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-270. Only two were built. In the 1950s, the British developed mixed-power jet designs employing both rocket and jet engines to cover the performance gap that existed in turbojet designs. The rocket was the main engine for delivering the speed and height required for high-speed interception of high-level bombers and the turbojet gave increased fuel economy in other parts of flight, most notably to ensure the aircraft was able to make a powered landing rather than risking an unpredictable gliding return. The Saunders-Roe SR.53 was a successful design, and was planned for production when economics forced the British to curtail most aircraft programs in the late 1950s. Furthermore, rapid advancements in jet engine technology rendered mixed-power aircraft designs like Saunders-Roe's SR.53 (and the following SR.177) obsolete. The American Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor –the first U.S. fighter to exceed Mach 1 in level flight– met a similar fate for the same reason, and no hybrid rocket-and-jet-engine fighter design has ever been placed into service. The only operational implementation of mixed propulsion was Rocket-Assisted Take Off (RATO), a system rarely used in fighters, such as with the zero-length launch, RATO-based takeoff scheme from special launch platforms, tested out by both the United States and the Soviet Union, and made obsolete with advancements in surface-to-air missile technology. It has become common in the aviation community to classify jet fighters by \"generations\" for historical purposes.[32] No official definitions of these generations exist; rather, they represent the notion of stages in the development of fighter-design approaches, performance capabilities, and technological evolution. Different authors have packed jet fighters into different generations. For example, Richard P. Hallion of the Secretary of the US Air Force's Action Group classified the F-16 as a sixth-generation jet fighter.[33] The timeframes associated with each generation remain inexact and are only indicative of the period during which their design philosophies and technology employment enjoyed a prevailing influence on fighter design and development. These timeframes also encompass the peak period of service entry for such aircraft. The first generation of jet fighters comprised the initial, subsonic jet-fighter designs introduced late in World War II (1939–1945) and in the early post-war period. They differed little from their piston-engined counterparts in appearance, and many employed unswept wings. Guns and cannon remained the principal armament. The need to obtain a decisive advantage in maximum speed pushed the development of turbojet-powered aircraft forward. Top speeds for fighters rose steadily throughout World War II as more powerful piston engines developed, and they approached transonic flight-speeds where the efficiency of propellers drops off, making further speed increases nearly impossible. The first jets developed during World War II and saw combat in the last two years of the war. Messerschmitt developed the first operational jet fighter, the Me 262A, primarily serving with the Luftwaffe's JG 7, the world's first jet-fighter wing. It was considerably faster than contemporary piston-driven aircraft, and in the hands of a competent pilot, proved quite difficult for Allied pilots to defeat. The Luftwaffe never deployed the design in numbers sufficient to stop the Allied air campaign, and a combination of fuel shortages, pilot losses, and technical difficulties with the engines kept the number of sorties low. Nevertheless, the Me 262 indicated the obsolescence of piston-driven aircraft. Spurred by reports of the German jets, Britain's Gloster Meteor entered production soon after, and the two entered service around the same time in 1944. Meteors commonly served to intercept the V-1 flying bomb, as they were faster than available piston-engined fighters at the low altitudes used by the flying bombs. Nearer the end of World War II, the first military jet-powered light-fighter design, the Luftwaffe intended the Heinkel He 162A Spatz (sparrow) to serve as a simple jet fighter for German home defense, with a few examples seeing squadron service with JG 1 by April 1945. By the end of the war almost all work on piston-powered fighters had ended. A few designs combining piston- and jet-engines for propulsion – such as the Ryan FR Fireball – saw brief use, but by the end of the 1940s virtually all new fighters were jet-powered. Despite their advantages, the early jet-fighters were far from perfect. The operational lifespan of turbines were very short and engines were temperamental, while power could be adjusted only slowly and acceleration was poor (even if top speed was higher) compared to the final generation of piston fighters. Many squadrons of piston-engined fighters remained in service until the early to mid-1950s, even in the air forces of the major powers (though the types retained were the best of the World War II designs). Innovations including ejection seats, air brakes and all-moving tailplanes became widespread in this period. The Americans began using jet fighters operationally after World War II, the wartime Bell P-59 having proven a failure. The Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star (soon re-designated F-80) was more prone to wave drag than the swept-wing Me 262, but had a cruise speed (660 km/h (410 mph)) as high as the maximum speed attainable by many piston-engined fighters. The British designed several new jets, including the distinctive single-engined twin boom de Havilland Vampire which Britain sold to the air forces of many nations. The British transferred the technology of the Rolls-Royce Nene jet-engine to the Soviets, who soon put it to use in their advanced Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighter, which used fully swept wings that allowed flying closer to the speed of sound than straight-winged designs such as the F-80. The MiG-15s' top speed of 1,075 km/h (668 mph) proved quite a shock to the American F-80 pilots who encountered them in the Korean War, along with their armament of two 23 mm (0.91 in) cannons and a single 37 mm (1.5 in) cannon. Nevertheless, in the first jet-versus-jet dogfight, which occurred during the Korean War on 8 November 1950, an F-80 shot down two North Korean MiG-15s. The Americans responded by rushing their own swept-wing fighter – the North American F-86 Sabre – into battle against the MiGs, which had similar transsonic performance. The two aircraft had different strengths and weaknesses, but were similar enough that victory could go either way. While the Sabres focused primarily on downing MiGs and scored favorably against those flown by the poorly trained North Koreans, the MiGs in turn decimated US bomber formations and forced the withdrawal of numerous American types from operational service. The world's navies also transitioned to jets during this period, despite the need for catapult-launching of the new aircraft. The U.S. Navy adopted the Grumman F9F Panther as their primary jet fighter in the Korean War period, and it was one of the first jet fighters to employ an afterburner. The de Havilland Sea Vampire became the Royal Navy's first jet fighter. Radar was used on specialized night-fighters such as the Douglas F3D Skyknight, which also downed MiGs over Korea, and later fitted to the McDonnell F2H Banshee and swept-wing Vought F7U Cutlass and McDonnell F3H Demon as all-weather / night fighters. Early versions of Infra-red (IR) air-to-air missiles (AAMs) such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder and radar-guided missiles such as the AIM-7 Sparrow whose descendants remain in use as of 2021[update], were first introduced on swept-wing subsonic Demon and Cutlass naval fighters. Technological breakthroughs, lessons learned from the aerial battles of the Korean War, and a focus on conducting operations in a nuclear warfare environment shaped the development of second-generation fighters. Technological advances in aerodynamics, propulsion and aerospace building-materials (primarily aluminum alloys) permitted designers to experiment with aeronautical innovations such as swept wings, delta wings, and area-ruled fuselages. Widespread use of afterburning turbojet engines made these the first production aircraft to break the sound barrier, and the ability to sustain supersonic speeds in level flight became a common capability amongst fighters of this generation. Fighter designs also took advantage of new electronics technologies that made effective radars small enough to carry aboard smaller aircraft. Onboard radars permitted detection of enemy aircraft beyond visual range, thereby improving the handoff of targets by longer-ranged ground-based warning- and tracking-radars. Similarly, advances in guided-missile development allowed air-to-air missiles to begin supplementing the gun as the primary offensive weapon for the first time in fighter history. During this period, passive-homing infrared-guided (IR) missiles became commonplace, but early IR missile sensors had poor sensitivity and a very narrow field of view (typically no more than 30°), which limited their effective use to only close-range, tail-chase engagements. Radar-guided (RF) missiles were introduced as well, but early examples proved unreliable. These semi-active radar homing (SARH) missiles could track and intercept an enemy aircraft \"painted\" by the launching aircraft's onboard radar. Medium- and long-range RF air-to-air missiles promised to open up a new dimension of \"beyond-visual-range\" (BVR) combat, and much effort concentrated on further development of this technology. The prospect of a potential third world war featuring large mechanized armies and nuclear-weapon strikes led to a degree of specialization along two design approaches: interceptors, such as the English Electric Lightning and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21F; and fighter-bombers, such as the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and the Sukhoi Su-7B. Dogfighting, per se, became de-emphasized in both cases. The interceptor was an outgrowth of the vision that guided missiles would completely replace guns and combat would take place at beyond-visual ranges. As a result, strategists designed interceptors with a large missile-payload and a powerful radar, sacrificing agility in favor of high speed, altitude ceiling and rate of climb. With a primary air-defense role, emphasis was placed on the ability to intercept strategic bombers flying at high altitudes. Specialized point-defense interceptors often had limited range and few, if any, ground-attack capabilities. Fighter-bombers could swing between air-superiority and ground-attack roles, and were often designed for a high-speed, low-altitude dash to deliver their ordnance. Television- and IR-guided air-to-surface missiles were introduced to augment traditional gravity bombs, and some were also equipped to deliver a nuclear bomb. The third generation witnessed continued maturation of second-generation innovations, but it is most marked by renewed emphases on maneuverability and on traditional ground-attack capabilities. Over the course of the 1960s, increasing combat experience with guided missiles demonstrated that combat would devolve into close-in dogfights. Analog avionics began to appear, replacing older \"steam-gauge\" cockpit instrumentation. Enhancements to the aerodynamic performance of third-generation fighters included flight control surfaces such as canards, powered slats, and blown flaps. A number of technologies would be tried for vertical/short takeoff and landing, but thrust vectoring would be successful on the Harrier. Growth in air-combat capability focused on the introduction of improved air-to-air missiles, radar systems, and other avionics. While guns remained standard equipment (early models of F-4 being a notable exception), air-to-air missiles became the primary weapons for air-superiority fighters, which employed more sophisticated radars and medium-range RF AAMs to achieve greater \"stand-off\" ranges, however, kill probabilities proved unexpectedly low for RF missiles due to poor reliability and improved electronic countermeasures (ECM) for spoofing radar seekers. Infrared-homing AAMs saw their fields of view expand to 45°, which strengthened their tactical usability. Nevertheless, the low dogfight loss-exchange ratios experienced by American fighters in the skies over Vietnam led the U.S. Navy to establish its famous \"TOPGUN\" fighter-weapons school, which provided a graduate-level curriculum to train fleet fighter-pilots in advanced Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) and Dissimilar air combat training (DACT) tactics and techniques. This era also saw an expansion in ground-attack capabilities, principally in guided missiles, and witnessed the introduction of the first truly effective avionics for enhanced ground attack, including terrain-avoidance systems. Air-to-surface missiles (ASM) equipped with electro-optical (E-O) contrast seekers – such as the initial model of the widely used AGM-65 Maverick – became standard weapons, and laser-guided bombs (LGBs) became widespread in an effort to improve precision-attack capabilities. Guidance for such precision-guided munitions (PGM) was provided by externally mounted targeting pods, which were introduced in the mid-1960s. The third generation also led to the development of new automatic-fire weapons, primarily chain-guns that use an electric motor to drive the mechanism of a cannon. This allowed a plane to carry a single multi-barrel weapon (such as the 20 mm (0.79 in) Vulcan), and provided greater accuracy and rates of fire. Powerplant reliability increased, and jet engines became \"smokeless\" to make it harder to sight aircraft at long distances. Dedicated ground-attack aircraft (like the Grumman A-6 Intruder, SEPECAT Jaguar and LTV A-7 Corsair II) offered longer range, more sophisticated night-attack systems or lower cost than supersonic fighters. With variable-geometry wings, the supersonic F-111 introduced the Pratt & Whitney TF30, the first turbofan equipped with afterburner. The ambitious project sought to create a versatile common fighter for many roles and services. It would serve well as an all-weather bomber, but lacked the performance to defeat other fighters. The McDonnell F-4 Phantom was designed to capitalize on radar and missile technology as an all-weather interceptor, but emerged as a versatile strike-bomber nimble enough to prevail in air combat, adopted by the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. Despite numerous shortcomings that would not be fully addressed until newer fighters, the Phantom claimed 280 aerial kills (more than any other U.S. fighter) over Vietnam.[34] With range and payload capabilities that rivaled that of World War II bombers such as B-24 Liberator, the Phantom would become a highly successful multirole aircraft. Fourth-generation fighters continued the trend towards multirole configurations, and were equipped with increasingly sophisticated avionics- and weapon-systems. Fighter designs were significantly influenced by the energy–maneuverability (E–M) theory developed by Colonel John Boyd and mathematician Thomas Christie, based upon Boyd's combat experience in the Korean War and as a fighter-tactics instructor during the 1960s. E-M theory emphasized the value of aircraft-specific energy maintenance as an advantage in fighter combat. Boyd perceived maneuverability as the primary means of getting \"inside\" an adversary's decision-making cycle, a process Boyd called the \"OODA loop\" (for \"Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action\"). This approach emphasized aircraft designs capable of performing \"fast transients\" – quick changes in speed, altitude, and direction – as opposed to relying chiefly on high speed alone. E–M characteristics were first applied to the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, but Boyd and his supporters believed these performance parameters called for a small, lightweight aircraft with a larger, higher-lift wing. The small size would minimize drag and increase the thrust-to-weight ratio, while the larger wing would minimize wing loading; while the reduced wing loading tends to lower top speed and can cut range, it increases payload capacity and the range reduction can be compensated for by increased fuel in the larger wing. The efforts of Boyd's \"Fighter mafia\" would result in the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon (now Lockheed Martin's). The F-16's maneuverability was further enhanced by its slight aerodynamic instability. This technique, called \"relaxed static stability\" (RSS), was made possible by introduction of the \"fly-by-wire\" (FBW) flight-control system (FLCS), which in turn was enabled by advances in computers and in system-integration techniques. Analog avionics, required to enable FBW operations, became a fundamental requirement, but began to be replaced by digital flight-control systems in the latter half of the 1980s. Likewise, Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC) to electronically manage powerplant performance was introduced with the Pratt & Whitney F100 turbofan. The F-16's sole reliance on electronics and wires to relay flight commands, instead of the usual cables and mechanical linkage controls, earned it the sobriquet of \"the electric jet\". Electronic FLCS and FADEC quickly became essential components of all subsequent fighter designs. Other innovative technologies introduced in fourth-generation fighters included pulse-Doppler fire-control radars (providing a \"look-down/shoot-down\" capability), head-up displays (HUD), \"hands on throttle-and-stick\" (HOTAS) controls, and multi-function displays (MFD), all essential equipment as of 2019[update]. Aircraft designers began to incorporate composite materials in the form of bonded-aluminum honeycomb structural elements and graphite epoxy laminate skins to reduce weight. Infrared search-and-track (IRST) sensors became widespread for air-to-ground weapons delivery, and appeared for air-to-air combat as well. \"All-aspect\" IR AAM became standard air superiority weapons, which permitted engagement of enemy aircraft from any angle (although the field of view remained relatively limited). The first long-range active-radar-homing RF AAM entered service with the AIM-54 Phoenix, which solely equipped the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, one of the few variable-sweep-wing fighter designs to enter production. Even with the tremendous advancement of air-to-air missiles in this era, internal guns were standard equipment. Another revolution came in the form of a stronger reliance on ease of maintenance, which led to standardization of parts, reductions in the numbers of access panels and lubrication points, and overall parts reduction in more complicated equipment like the engines. Some early jet fighters required 50 man-hours of work by a ground crew for every hour the aircraft was in the air; later models substantially reduced this to allow faster turn-around times and more sorties in a day. Some modern military aircraft only require 10-man-hours of work per hour of flight time, and others are even more efficient. Aerodynamic innovations included variable-camber wings and exploitation of the vortex lift effect to achieve higher angles of attack through the addition of leading-edge extension devices such as strakes. Unlike interceptors of the previous eras, most fourth-generation air-superiority fighters were designed to be agile dogfighters (although the Mikoyan MiG-31 and Panavia Tornado ADV are notable exceptions). The continually rising cost of fighters, however, continued to emphasize the value of multirole fighters. The need for both types of fighters led to the \"high/low mix\" concept, which envisioned a high-capability and high-cost core of dedicated air-superiority fighters (like the F-15 and Su-27) supplemented by a larger contingent of lower-cost multi-role fighters (such as the F-16 and MiG-29). Most fourth-generation fighters, such as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, HAL Tejas, JF-17 and Dassault Mirage 2000, are true multirole warplanes, designed as such from the start. This was facilitated by multimode avionics that could switch seamlessly between air and ground modes. The earlier approaches of adding on strike capabilities or designing separate models specialized for different roles generally became passé (with the Panavia Tornado being an exception in this regard). Attack roles were generally assigned to dedicated ground-attack aircraft such as the Sukhoi Su-25 and the A-10 Thunderbolt II. A typical US Air Force fighter wing of the period might contain a mix of one air superiority squadron (F-15C), one strike fighter squadron (F-15E), and two multirole fighter squadrons (F-16C).[35] Perhaps the most novel technology introduced for combat aircraft was stealth, which involves the use of special \"low-observable\" (L-O) materials and design techniques to reduce the susceptibility of an aircraft to detection by the enemy's sensor systems, particularly radars. The first stealth aircraft introduced were the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk attack aircraft (introduced in 1983) and the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber (first flew in 1989). Although no stealthy fighters per se appeared among the fourth generation, some radar-absorbent coatings and other L-O treatments developed for these programs are reported to have been subsequently applied to fourth-generation fighters. The end of the Cold War in December 1991 led many governments to significantly decrease military spending as a \"peace dividend\". Air force inventories were cut. Research and development programs working on \"fifth-generation\" fighters took serious hits. Many programs were canceled during the first half of the 1990s, and those that survived were \"stretched out\". While the practice of slowing the pace of development reduces annual investment expenses, it comes at the penalty of increased overall program and unit costs over the long-term. In this instance, however, it also permitted designers to make use of the tremendous achievements being made in the fields of computers, avionics and other flight electronics, which had become possible largely due to the advances made in microchip and semiconductor technologies in the 1980s and 1990s. This opportunity enabled designers to develop fourth-generation designs – or redesigns – with significantly enhanced capabilities. These improved designs have become known as \"Generation 4.5\" fighters, recognizing their intermediate nature between the 4th and 5th generations, and their contribution in furthering development of individual fifth-generation technologies. The primary characteristics of this sub-generation are the application of advanced digital avionics and aerospace materials, modest signature reduction (primarily RF \"stealth\"), and highly integrated systems and weapons. These fighters have been designed to operate in a \"network-centric\" battlefield environment and are principally multirole aircraft. Key weapons technologies introduced include beyond-visual-range (BVR) AAMs; Global Positioning System (GPS)–guided weapons, solid-state phased-array radars; helmet-mounted sights; and improved secure, jamming-resistant datalinks. Thrust vectoring to further improve transient maneuvering capabilities has also been adopted by many 4.5th generation fighters, and uprated powerplants have enabled some designs to achieve a degree of \"supercruise\" ability. Stealth characteristics are focused primarily on frontal-aspect radar cross section (RCS) signature-reduction techniques including radar-absorbent materials (RAM), L-O coatings and limited shaping techniques. \"Half-generation\" designs are either based on existing airframes or are based on new airframes following similar design theory to previous iterations; however, these modifications have introduced the structural use of composite materials to reduce weight, greater fuel fractions to increase range, and signature reduction treatments to achieve lower RCS compared to their predecessors. Prime examples of such aircraft, which are based on new airframe designs making extensive use of carbon-fiber composites, include the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Saab JAS 39 Gripen, JF-17 Thunder, and HAL Tejas Mark 1A. Apart from these fighter jets, most of the 4.5 generation aircraft are actually modified variants of existing airframes from the earlier fourth generation fighter jets. Such fighter jets are generally heavier and examples include the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, which is an evolution of the F/A-18 Hornet, the F-15E Strike Eagle, which is a ground-attack/multi-role variant of the F-15 Eagle, the Su-30SM and Su-35S modified variants of the Sukhoi Su-27, and the MiG-35 upgraded version of the Mikoyan MiG-29. The Su-30SM/Su-35S and MiG-35 feature thrust vectoring engine nozzles to enhance maneuvering. The upgraded version of F-16 is also considered a member of the 4.5 generation aircraft.[36] Generation 4.5 fighters first entered service in the early 1990s, and most of them are still being produced and evolved. It is quite possible that they may continue in production alongside fifth-generation fighters due to the expense of developing the advanced level of stealth technology needed to achieve aircraft designs featuring very low observables (VLO), which is one of the defining features of fifth-generation fighters. Of the 4.5th generation designs, the Strike Eagle, Super Hornet, Typhoon, Gripen, and Rafale have been used in combat. The U.S. government has defined 4.5 generation fighter aircraft as those that \"(1) have advanced capabilities, including— (A) AESA radar; (B) high capacity data-link; and (C) enhanced avionics; and (2) have the ability to deploy current and reasonably foreseeable advanced armaments.\"[37][38] Currently the cutting edge of fighter design, fifth-generation fighters are characterized by being designed from the start to operate in a network-centric combat environment, and to feature extremely low, all-aspect, multi-spectral signatures employing advanced materials and shaping techniques. They have multifunction AESA radars with high-bandwidth, low-probability of intercept (LPI) data transmission capabilities. The infra-red search and track sensors incorporated for air-to-air combat as well as for air-to-ground weapons delivery in the 4.5th generation fighters are now fused in with other sensors for Situational Awareness IRST or SAIRST, which constantly tracks all targets of interest around the aircraft so the pilot need not guess when he glances. These sensors, along with advanced avionics, glass cockpits, helmet-mounted sights (not currently on F-22), and improved secure, jamming-resistant LPI datalinks are highly integrated to provide multi-platform, multi-sensor data fusion for vastly improved situational awareness while easing the pilot's workload.[39] Avionics suites rely on extensive use of very high-speed integrated circuit (VHSIC) technology, common modules, and high-speed data buses. Overall, the integration of all these elements is claimed to provide fifth-generation fighters with a \"first-look, first-shot, first-kill capability\". A key attribute of fifth-generation fighters is a small radar cross-section. Great care has been taken in designing its layout and internal structure to minimize RCS over a broad bandwidth of detection and tracking radar frequencies; furthermore, to maintain its VLO signature during combat operations, primary weapons are carried in internal weapon bays that are only briefly opened to permit weapon launch. Furthermore, stealth technology has advanced to the point where it can be employed without a tradeoff with aerodynamics performance, in contrast to previous stealth efforts. Some attention has also been paid to reducing IR signatures, especially on the F-22. Detailed information on these signature-reduction techniques is classified, but in general includes special shaping approaches, thermoset and thermoplastic materials, extensive structural use of advanced composites, conformal sensors, heat-resistant coatings, low-observable wire meshes to cover intake and cooling vents, heat ablating tiles on the exhaust troughs (seen on the Northrop YF-23), and coating internal and external metal areas with radar-absorbent materials and paint (RAM/RAP). The AESA radar offers unique capabilities for fighters (and it is also quickly becoming essential for Generation 4.5 aircraft designs, as well as being retrofitted onto some fourth-generation aircraft). In addition to its high resistance to ECM and LPI features, it enables the fighter to function as a sort of \"mini-AWACS\", providing high-gain electronic support measures (ESM) and electronic warfare (EW) jamming functions. Other technologies common to this latest generation of fighters includes integrated electronic warfare system (INEWS) technology, integrated communications, navigation, and identification (CNI) avionics technology, centralized \"vehicle health monitoring\" systems for ease of maintenance, fiber optics data transmission, stealth technology and even hovering capabilities. Maneuver performance remains important and is enhanced by thrust-vectoring, which also helps reduce takeoff and landing distances. Supercruise may or may not be featured; it permits flight at supersonic speeds without the use of the afterburner – a device that significantly increases IR signature when used in full military power. Such aircraft are sophisticated and expensive. The fifth generation was ushered in by the Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor in late 2005. The U.S. Air Force originally planned to acquire 650 F-22s, but now only 187 will be built. As a result, its unit flyaway cost (FAC) is around US$150 million. To spread the development costs – and production base – more broadly, the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program enrolls eight other countries as cost- and risk-sharing partners. Altogether, the nine partner nations anticipate procuring over 3,000 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighters at an anticipated average FAC of $80–85 million. The F-35, however, is designed to be a family of three aircraft, a conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) fighter, a short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) fighter, and a Catapult Assisted Take Off But Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) fighter, each of which has a different unit price and slightly varying specifications in terms of fuel capacity (and therefore range), size and payload. Other countries have initiated fifth-generation fighter development projects. In December 2010, it was discovered that China is developing the 5th generation fighter Chengdu J-20.[40] The J-20 took its maiden flight in January 2011. The Shenyang J-35 took its maiden flight on 31 October 2012,[41] and developed a carrier-based version based on Chinese aircraft carriers.[42][43] United Aircraft Corporation with Russia's Mikoyan LMFS and Sukhoi Su-75 Checkmate plan, Sukhoi Su-57 became the first fifth-generation fighter jets in service with the Russian Aerospace Forces on 2020,[44] and launch missiles in the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2022.[45] Japan is exploring its technical feasibility to produce fifth-generation fighters. India is developing the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), a medium weight stealth fighter jet designated to enter into serial production by late 2030s. India also had initiated a joint fifth generation heavy fighter with Russia called the FGFA. As of 2018[update] May, the project is suspected to have not yielded desired progress or results for India and has been put on hold or dropped altogether.[46] Other countries considering fielding an indigenous or semi-indigenous advanced fifth generation aircraft include South Korea, Sweden, Turkey and Pakistan. As of November 2018, France, Germany, China, Japan, Russia, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States have announced the development of a sixth-generation aircraft program. France and Germany will develop a joint sixth-generation fighter to replace their current fleet of Dassault Rafales, Eurofighter Typhoons, and Panavia Tornados by 2035.[47] The overall development will be led by a collaboration of Dassault and Airbus, while the engines will reportedly be jointly developed by Safran and MTU Aero Engines. Thales and MBDA are also seeking a stake in the project.[48] Spain officially joined the Franco-German project to develop a Next-Generation Fighter (NGF) that will form part of a broader Future Combat Air Systems (FCAS) with the signing of a letter of intent (LOI) on February 14, 2019.[48][49] Currently at the concept stage, the first sixth-generation jet fighter is expected to enter service in the United States Navy in 2025–30 period.[50] The USAF seeks a new fighter for the 2030–50 period named the \"Next Generation Tactical Aircraft\" (\"Next Gen TACAIR\").[51][52] The US Navy looks to replace its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets beginning in 2025 with the Next Generation Air Dominance air superiority fighter.[53][54] The United Kingdom's proposed stealth fighter is being developed along with Japan and Italy in Team Tempest, consisting of BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo S.p.A. and MBDA. The aircraft is intended to enter service in 2035.[55][56] Saudi Arabia is also looking to get involved in Team Tempest.[57] Fighters were typically armed with guns only for air to air combat up through the late 1950s, though unguided rockets for mostly air to ground use and limited air to air use were deployed in WWII. From the late 1950s forward guided missiles came into use for air to air combat. Throughout this history fighters which by surprise or maneuver attain a good firing position have achieved the kill about one third to one half the time, no matter what weapons were carried.[58] The only major historic exception to this has been the low effectiveness shown by guided missiles in the first one to two decades of their existence.[59][60] From WWI to the present, fighter aircraft have featured machine guns and automatic cannons as weapons, and they are still considered as essential back-up weapons today. The power of air-to-air guns has increased greatly over time, and has kept them relevant in the guided missile era.[61] In WWI two rifle (approximately 0.30) caliber machine guns was the typical armament, producing a weight of fire of about 0.4 kg (0.88 lb) per second. In WWII rifle caliber machine guns also remained common, though usually in larger numbers or supplemented with much heavier 0.50 caliber machine guns or cannons. The standard WWII American fighter armament of six 0.50-cal (12.7mm) machine guns fired a bullet weight of approximately 3.7 kg/sec (8.1 lbs/sec), at a muzzle velocity of 856 m/s (2,810 ft/s). British and German aircraft tended to use a mix of machine guns and autocannon, the latter firing explosive projectiles. Later British fighters were exclusively cannon-armed, the US were not able to produce a reliable cannon in high numbers and most fighters remained equipped only with heavy machine guns despite the US Navy pressing for a change to 20 mm.[62] Post war 20–30 mm revolver cannon and rotary cannon were introduced. The modern M61 Vulcan 20mm rotary cannon that is standard on current American fighters fires a projectile weight of about 10 kg/s (22 lb/s), nearly three times that of six 0.50-cal machine guns, with higher velocity of 1,052 m/s (3450 ft/s) supporting a flatter trajectory, and with exploding projectiles.[63] Modern fighter gun systems also feature ranging radar and lead computing electronic gun sights to ease the problem of aim point to compensate for projectile drop and time of flight (target lead) in the complex three dimensional maneuvering of air-to-air combat. However, getting in position to use the guns is still a challenge. The range of guns is longer than in the past but still quite limited compared to missiles, with modern gun systems having a maximum effective range of approximately 1,000 meters.[64] High probability of kill also requires firing to usually occur from the rear hemisphere of the target.[65] Despite these limits, when pilots are well trained in air-to-air gunnery and these conditions are satisfied, gun systems are tactically effective and highly cost efficient. The cost of a gun firing pass is far less than firing a missile,[b] and the projectiles are not subject to the thermal and electronic countermeasures than can sometimes defeat missiles. When the enemy can be approached to within gun range, the lethality of guns is approximately a 25% to 50% chance of \"kill per firing pass\".[66] The range limitations of guns, and the desire to overcome large variations in fighter pilot skill and thus achieve higher force effectiveness, led to the development of the guided air-to-air missile. There are two main variations, heat-seeking (infrared homing), and radar guided. Radar missiles are typically several times heavier and more expensive than heat-seekers, but with longer range, greater destructive power, and ability to track through clouds. The highly successful AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking (infrared homing) short-range missile was developed by the United States Navy in the 1950s. These small missiles are easily carried by lighter fighters, and provide effective ranges of approximately 10 to 35 kilometres (6 to 20 mi). Beginning with the AIM-9L in 1977, subsequent versions of Sidewinder have added all-aspect capability, the ability to use the lower heat of air to skin friction on the target aircraft to track from the front and sides. The latest (2003 service entry) AIM-9X also features \"off-boresight\" and \"lock on after launch\" capabilities, which allow the pilot to make a quick launch of a missile to track a target anywhere within the pilot's vision. The AIM-9X development cost was U.S. $3 billion in mid to late 1990s dollars,[67] and 2015 per unit procurement cost is $0.6 million each. The missile weighs 85.3 kg (188 lbs), and has a maximum range of 35 km (22 miles) at higher altitudes. Like most air-to-air missiles, lower altitude range can be as limited as only about one third of maximum due to higher drag and less ability to coast downward.[68] The effectiveness of infrared homing missiles was only 7% early in the Vietnam War,[69] but improved to approximately 15%–40% over the course of the war. The AIM-4 Falcon used by the USAF had kill rates of approximately 7% and was considered a failure. The AIM-9B Sidewinder introduced later achieved 15% kill rates, and the further improved AIM-9D and J models reached 19%. The AIM-9G used in the last year of the Vietnam air war achieved 40%.[70] Israel used almost totally guns in the 1967 Six-Day War, achieving 60 kills and 10 losses.[71] However, Israel made much more use of steadily improving heat-seeking missiles in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In this extensive conflict Israel scored 171 of 261 total kills with heat-seeking missiles (65.5%), 5 kills with radar guided missiles (1.9%), and 85 kills with guns (32.6%).[72] The AIM-9L Sidewinder scored 19 kills out of 26 fired missiles (73%) in the 1982 Falklands War.[73] But, in a conflict against opponents using thermal countermeasures, the United States only scored 11 kills out of 48 fired (Pk = 23%) with the follow-on AIM-9M in the 1991 Gulf War.[74] Radar guided missiles fall into two main missile guidance types. In the historically more common semi-active radar homing case the missile homes in on radar signals transmitted from launching aircraft and reflected from the target. This has the disadvantage that the firing aircraft must maintain radar lock on the target and is thus less free to maneuver and more vulnerable to attack. A widely deployed missile of this type was the AIM-7 Sparrow, which entered service in 1954 and was produced in improving versions until 1997. In more advanced active radar homing the missile is guided to the vicinity of the target by internal data on its projected position, and then \"goes active\" with an internally carried small radar system to conduct terminal guidance to the target. This eliminates the requirement for the firing aircraft to maintain radar lock, and thus greatly reduces risk. A prominent example is the AIM-120 AMRAAM, which was first fielded in 1991 as the AIM-7 replacement, and which has no firm retirement date as of 2016[update]. The current AIM-120D version has a maximum high altitude range of greater than 160 km (100 mi), and cost approximately $2.4 million each (2016). As is typical with most other missiles, range at lower altitude may be as little as one third that of high altitude. In the Vietnam air war radar missile kill reliability was approximately 10% at shorter ranges, and even worse at longer ranges due to reduced radar return and greater time for the target aircraft to detect the incoming missile and take evasive action. At one point in the Vietnam war, the U.S. Navy fired 50 AIM-7 Sparrow radar guided missiles in a row without a hit.[75] Between 1958 and 1982 in five wars there were 2,014 combined heat-seeking and radar guided missile firings by fighter pilots engaged in air-to-air combat, achieving 528 kills, of which 76 were radar missile kills, for a combined effectiveness of 26%. However, only 4 of the 76 radar missile kills were in the beyond-visual-range mode intended to be the strength of radar guided missiles.[76] The United States invested over $10 billion in air-to-air radar missile technology from the 1950s to the early 1970s.[77] Amortized over actual kills achieved by the U.S. and its allies, each radar guided missile kill thus cost over $130 million. The defeated enemy aircraft were for the most part older MiG-17s, −19s, and −21s, with new cost of $0.3 million to $3 million each. Thus, the radar missile investment over that period far exceeded the value of enemy aircraft destroyed, and furthermore had very little of the intended BVR effectiveness. However, continuing heavy development investment and rapidly advancing electronic technology led to significant improvement in radar missile reliabilities from the late 1970s onward. Radar guided missiles achieved 75% Pk (9 kills out of 12 shots) in operations in the Gulf War in 1991.[78] The percentage of kills achieved by radar guided missiles also surpassed 50% of total kills for the first time by 1991. Since 1991, 20 of 61 kills worldwide have been beyond-visual-range using radar missiles.[79] Discounting an accidental friendly fire kill, in operational use the AIM-120D (the current main American radar guided missile) has achieved 9 kills out of 16 shots for a 56% Pk. Six of these kills were BVR, out of 13 shots, for a 46% BVR Pk.[80] Though all these kills were against less capable opponents who were not equipped with operating radar, electronic countermeasures, or a comparable weapon themselves, the BVR Pk was a significant improvement from earlier eras. However, a current concern is electronic countermeasures to radar missiles,[81] which are thought to be reducing the effectiveness of the AIM-120D. Some experts believe that as of 2016[update] the European Meteor missile, the Russian R-37M, and the Chinese PL-15 are more resistant to countermeasures and more effective than the AIM-120D.[81] Now that higher reliabilities have been achieved, both types of missiles allow the fighter pilot to often avoid the risk of the short-range dogfight, where only the more experienced and skilled fighter pilots tend to prevail, and where even the finest fighter pilot can simply get unlucky. Taking maximum advantage of complicated missile parameters in both attack and defense against competent opponents does take considerable experience and skill,[82] but against surprised opponents lacking comparable capability and countermeasures, air-to-air missile warfare is relatively simple. By partially automating air-to-air combat and reducing reliance on gun kills mostly achieved by only a small expert fraction of fighter pilots, air-to-air missiles now serve as highly effective force multipliers.

Aerospace activity is very diverse, with a multitude of commercial, industrial, and military applications. Aerospace engineering consists of aeronautics and astronautics. Aerospace organizations research, design, manufacture, operate, maintain, and repair both aircraft and spacecraft.[1] The border between space and the atmosphere has been proposed as 100 kilometres (62.1 mi) above the ground according to the physical explanation that the air density is too low for a lifting body to generate meaningful lift force without exceeding orbital velocity. This border has been called the Kármán line.[2] In most industrial countries, the aerospace industry is a co-operation of the public and private sectors. For example, several states have a civilian space program funded by the government, such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the United States, European Space Agency in Europe, the Canadian Space Agency in Canada, Indian Space Research Organisation in India, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in Japan, Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities in Russia, China National Space Administration in China, SUPARCO in Pakistan, Iranian Space Agency in Iran, and Korea Aerospace Research Institute in South Korea. Along with these public space programs, many companies produce technical tools and components such as spacecraft and satellites. Some known companies involved in space programs include Boeing, Cobham, Airbus, SpaceX, Lockheed Martin, RTX Corporation, MDA and Northrop Grumman. These companies are also involved in other areas of aerospace, such as the construction of aircraft. Modern aerospace began with Engineer George Cayley in 1799. Cayley proposed an aircraft with a \"fixed wing and a horizontal and vertical tail,\" defining characteristics of the modern aeroplane.[3] The 19th century saw the creation of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain (1866), the American Rocketry Society, and the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences, all of which made aeronautics a more serious scientific discipline.[3] Airmen like Otto Lilienthal, who introduced cambered airfoils in 1891, used gliders to analyze aerodynamic forces.[3] The Wright brothers were interested in Lilienthal's work and read several of his publications.[3] They also found inspiration in Octave Chanute, an airman and the author of Progress in Flying Machines (1894).[3] It was the preliminary work of Cayley, Lilienthal, Chanute, and other early aerospace engineers that brought about the first powered sustained flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina on December 17, 1903, by the Wright brothers. War and science fiction inspired scientists and engineers like Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Wernher von Braun to achieve flight beyond the atmosphere. World War II inspired Wernher von Braun to create the V1 and V2 rockets. The launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957 started the Space Age, and on July 20, 1969 Apollo 11 achieved the first crewed Moon landing.[3] In April 1981, the Space Shuttle Columbia launched, the start of regular crewed access to orbital space. A sustained human presence in orbital space started with \"Mir\" in 1986 and is continued by the \"International Space Station\".[3] Space commercialization and space tourism are more recent features of aerospace. Aerospace manufacturing is a high-technology industry that produces \"aircraft, guided missiles, space vehicles, aircraft engines, propulsion units, and related parts\".[4] Most of the industry is geared toward governmental work. For each original equipment manufacturer (OEM), the US government has assigned a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code. These codes help to identify each manufacturer, repair facilities, and other critical aftermarket vendors in the aerospace industry. In the United States, the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are the two largest consumers of aerospace technology and products. Others include the very large airline industry. The aerospace industry employed 472,000 wage and salary workers in 2006.[5] Most of those jobs were in Washington state and in California, with Missouri, New York and Texas also being important. The leading aerospace manufacturers in the U.S. are Boeing, United Technologies Corporation, SpaceX, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. As talented American employees age and retire, these manufacturers face an expanding labor shortfall. In order to supply the industrial sector with fresh workers, apprenticeship programs like the Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Council (AJAC) collaborate with community colleges and aerospace firms in Washington state. Important locations of the civilian aerospace industry worldwide include Washington state (Boeing), California (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, etc.) and Montreal, Quebec, Canada (Bombardier, Pratt & Whitney Canada) in North America; Toulouse, France (Airbus) and Hamburg, Germany (Airbus) in Europe; as well as São José dos Campos, Brazil (Embraer), Querétaro, Mexico (Bombardier Aerospace, General Electric Aviation) and Mexicali, Mexico (United Technologies Corporation, Gulfstream Aerospace) in Latin America. In the European Union, aerospace companies such as Airbus, Safran, Thales, Dassault Aviation, Leonardo and Saab AB account for a large share of the global aerospace industry and research effort, with the European Space Agency as one of the largest consumers of aerospace technology and products. In India, Bangalore is a major center of the aerospace industry, where Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the National Aerospace Laboratories and the Indian Space Research Organisation are headquartered. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched India's first Moon orbiter, Chandrayaan-1, in October 2008. In Russia, large aerospace companies like Oboronprom and the United Aircraft Building Corporation (encompassing Mikoyan, Sukhoi, Ilyushin, Tupolev, Yakovlev, and Irkut which includes Beriev) are among the major global players in this industry. The historic Soviet Union was also the home of a major aerospace industry. The United Kingdom formerly attempted to maintain its own large aerospace industry, making its own airliners and warplanes, but it has largely turned its lot over to cooperative efforts with continental companies, and it has turned into a large import customer, too, from countries such as the United States. However, the United Kingdom has a very active aerospace sector, with major companies such as BAE Systems, supplying fully assembled aircraft, aircraft components, sub-assemblies and sub-systems to other manufacturers, both in Europe and all over the world. Canada has formerly manufactured some of its own designs for jet warplanes, etc. (e.g. the CF-100 fighter), but for some decades, it has relied on imports from the United States and Europe to fill these needs. However Canada still manufactures some military aircraft although they are generally not combat capable. Another notable example was the late 1950s development of the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, a supersonic fighter-interceptor whose 1959 cancellation was considered highly controversial. France has continued to make its own warplanes for its air force and navy, and Sweden continues to make its own warplanes for the Swedish Air Force—especially in support of its position as a neutral country. (See Saab AB.) Other European countries either team up in making fighters (such as the Panavia Tornado and the Eurofighter Typhoon), or else to import them from the United States. Pakistan has a developing aerospace engineering industry. The National Engineering and Scientific Commission, Khan Research Laboratories and Pakistan Aeronautical Complex are among the premier organizations involved in research and development in this sector. Pakistan has the capability of designing and manufacturing guided rockets, missiles and space vehicles. The city of Kamra is home to the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex which contains several factories. This facility is responsible for manufacturing the MFI-17, MFI-395, K-8 and JF-17 Thunder aircraft. Pakistan also has the capability to design and manufacture both armed and unarmed unmanned aerial vehicles. In the People's Republic of China, Beijing, Xi'an, Chengdu, Shanghai, Shenyang and Nanchang are major research and manufacture centers of the aerospace industry. China has developed an extensive capability to design, test and produce military aircraft, missiles and space vehicles. Despite the cancellation in 1983 of the experimental Shanghai Y-10, China is still developing its civil aerospace industry. The aircraft parts industry was born out of the sale of second-hand or used aircraft parts from the aerospace manufacture sector. Within the United States there is a specific process that parts brokers or resellers must follow. This includes leveraging a certified repair station to overhaul and \"tag\" a part. This certification guarantees that a part was repaired or overhauled to meet OEM specifications. Once a part is overhauled its value is determined from the supply and demand of the aerospace market. When an airline has an aircraft on the ground, the part that the airline requires to get the plane back into service becomes invaluable. This can drive the market for specific parts. There are several online marketplaces that assist with the commodity selling of aircraft parts. In the aerospace and defense industry, much consolidation occurred at the end of the 20th century and in the early 21st century. Between 1988 and 2011, more than 6,068 mergers and acquisitions with a total known value of US$678 billion were announced worldwide.[6] The largest transactions have been: Multiple technologies and innovations are used in aerospace, many of them pioneered around World War II:[11] Functional safety relates to a part of the general safety of a system or a piece of equipment. It implies that the system or equipment can be operated properly and without causing any danger, risk, damage or injury. Functional safety is crucial in the aerospace industry, which allows no compromises or negligence. In this respect, supervisory bodies, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency,[12] regulate the aerospace market with strict certification standards. This is meant to reach and ensure the highest possible level of safety. The standards AS 9100 in America, EN 9100 on the European market or JISQ 9100 in Asia particularly address the aerospace and aviation industry. These are standards applying to the functional safety of aerospace vehicles. Some companies are therefore specialized in the certification, inspection, verification and testing of the vehicles and spare parts to ensure and attest compliance with the appropriate regulations. Spinoffs refer to any technology that is a direct result of coding or products created by NASA and redesigned for an alternate purpose.[13] These technological advancements are one of the primary results of the aerospace industry, with $5.2 billion worth of revenue generated by spinoff technology, including computers and cellular devices.[13] These spinoffs have applications in a variety of different fields including medicine, transportation, energy, consumer goods, public safety and more.[13] NASA publishes an annual report called \"Spinoffs\", regarding many of the specific products and benefits to the aforementioned areas in an effort to highlight some of the ways funding is put to use.[14] For example, in the most recent edition of this publication, \"Spinoffs 2015\", endoscopes are featured as one of the medical derivations of aerospace achievement.[13] This device enables more precise and subsequently cost-effective neurosurgery by reducing complications through a minimally invasive procedure that abbreviates hospitalization.[13] \"These NASA technologies are not only giving companies and entrepreneurs a competitive edge in their own industries, but are also helping to shape budding industries, such as commercial lunar landers,\" said Daniel Lockney.[15]"}

Avionics engineering is similar, but deals with the electronics side of aerospace engineering. \"Aeronautical engineering\" was the original term for the field. As flight technology advanced to include vehicles operating in outer space, the broader term \"aerospace engineering\" has come into use.[4] Aerospace engineering, particularly the astronautics branch, is often colloquially referred to as \"rocket science\".[5][a] Flight vehicles are subjected to demanding conditions such as those caused by changes in atmospheric pressure and temperature, with structural loads applied upon vehicle components. Consequently, they are usually the products of various technological and engineering disciplines including aerodynamics, air propulsion, avionics, materials science, structural analysis and manufacturing. The interaction between these technologies is known as aerospace engineering. Because of the complexity and number of disciplines involved, aerospace engineering is carried out by teams of engineers, each having their own specialized area of expertise.[7] The origin of aerospace engineering can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the late 19th to early 20th centuries, although the work of Sir George Cayley dates from the last decade of the 18th to the mid-19th century. One of the most important people in the history of aeronautics[8] and a pioneer in aeronautical engineering,[9] Cayley is credited as the first person to separate the forces of lift and drag, which affect any atmospheric flight vehicle.[10] Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical, with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.[11] Some key elements, like fluid dynamics, were understood by 18th-century scientists.[12] In December 1903, the Wright Brothers performed the first sustained, controlled flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft, lasting 12 seconds. The 1910s saw the development of aeronautical engineering through the design of World War I military aircraft. In 1914, Robert Goddard was granted two U.S. patents for rockets using solid fuel, liquid fuel, multiple propellant charges, and multi-stage designs.[13] This would set the stage for future applications in multi-stage propulsion systems for outer space. On March 3, 1915, the U.S. Congress established the first aeronautical research administration, known as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NACA.[14] It was the first government-sponsored organization to support aviation research.[13] Though intended as an advisory board upon inception, the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory became its first sponsored research and testing facility in 1920.[15] Between World Wars I and II, great leaps were made in the field, accelerated by the advent of mainstream civil aviation. Notable airplanes of this era include the Curtiss JN 4, Farman F.60 Goliath, and Fokker Trimotor. Notable military airplanes of this period include the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, Supermarine Spitfire and Messerschmitt Bf 109 from Japan, United Kingdom, and Germany respectively. A significant development came with the first operational Jet engine-powered airplane, the Messerschmitt Me 262 which entered service in 1944 towards the end of the Second World War.[16] The first definition of aerospace engineering appeared in February 1958,[4] considering the Earth's atmosphere and outer space as a single realm, thereby encompassing both aircraft (aero) and spacecraft (space) under the newly coined term aerospace. In response to the USSR launching the first satellite, Sputnik, into space on October 4, 1957, U.S. aerospace engineers launched the first American satellite on January 31, 1958. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration was founded in 1958 after the Sputnik crisis. In 1969, Apollo 11, the first human space mission to land on the Moon, took place. It saw three astronauts enter orbit around the Moon, with two, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, visiting the lunar surface. The third astronaut, Michael Collins, stayed in orbit to rendezvous with Armstrong and Aldrin after their visit.[17] An important innovation came on January 30, 1970, when the Boeing 747 made its first commercial flight from New York to London. This aircraft made history and became known as the \"Jumbo Jet\" or \"Queen of the Skies\"[18] due to its ability to hold up to 480 passengers. Another significant development came in 1976, with the development of the first passenger supersonic aircraft, the Concorde. The development of this aircraft was agreed upon by the French and British on November 29, 1962.[19] On December 21, 1988, the Antonov An-225 Mriya cargo aircraft commenced its first flight. It holds the records for the world's heaviest aircraft, heaviest airlifted cargo, and longest airlifted cargo of any aircraft in operational service.[20] On October 25, 2007, the Airbus A380 made its maiden commercial flight from Singapore to Sydney, Australia. This aircraft was the first passenger plane to surpass the Boeing 747 in terms of passenger capacity, with a maximum of 853. Though development of this aircraft began in 1988 as a competitor to the 747, the A380 made its first test flight in April 2005.[21] Some of the elements of aerospace engineering are:[22][23] The basis of most of these elements lies in theoretical physics, such as fluid dynamics for aerodynamics or the equations of motion for flight dynamics. There is also a large empirical component. Historically, this empirical component was derived from testing of scale models and prototypes, either in wind tunnels or in the free atmosphere. More recently, advances in computing have enabled the use of computational fluid dynamics to simulate the behavior of the fluid, reducing time and expense spent on wind-tunnel testing. Those studying hydrodynamics or hydroacoustics often obtain degrees in aerospace engineering. Additionally, aerospace engineering addresses the integration of all components that constitute an aerospace vehicle (subsystems including power, aerospace bearings, communications, thermal control, life support system, etc.) and its life cycle (design, temperature, pressure, radiation, velocity, lifetime). Aerospace engineering may be studied at the advanced diploma, bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. levels in aerospace engineering departments at many universities, and in mechanical engineering departments at others. A few departments offer degrees in space-focused astronautical engineering. Some institutions differentiate between aeronautical and astronautical engineering. Graduate degrees are offered in advanced or specialty areas for the aerospace industry. A background in chemistry, physics, computer science and mathematics is important for students pursuing an aerospace engineering degree.[25] The term \"rocket scientist\" is sometimes used to describe a person of great intelligence since rocket science is seen as a practice requiring great mental ability, especially technically and mathematically. The term is used ironically in the expression \"It's not rocket science\" to indicate that a task is simple.[26] Strictly speaking, the use of \"science\" in \"rocket science\" is a misnomer since science is about understanding the origins, nature, and behavior of the universe; engineering is about using scientific and engineering principles to solve problems and develop new technology.[5][6] The more etymologically correct version of this phrase would be \"rocket engineer\". However, \"science\" and \"engineering\" are often misused as synonyms.[5][6][27]"}

Aerospace is a high technology industry. The aircraft industry is the industry supporting aviation by building aircraft and manufacturing aircraft parts for their maintenance. This includes aircraft and parts used for civil aviation and military aviation. Most production is done pursuant to type certificates and Defense Standards issued by a government body. This term has been largely subsumed by the more encompassing term: \"aerospace industry\". In 2015 the aircraft production was worth US$180.3 billion: 61% airliners, 14% business and general aviation, 12% military aircraft, 10% military rotary wing and 3% civil rotary wing; while their MRO was worth $135.1 Bn or $315.4 Bn combined.[1] The global aerospace industry was worth $838.5 billion in 2017: aircraft & engine OEMs represented 28% ($235 Bn), civil & military MRO & upgrades 27% ($226 Bn), aircraft systems & component manufacturing 26% ($218 Bn), satellites & space 7% ($59 Bn), missiles & UAVs 5% ($42 Bn) and other activity, including flight simulators, defense electronics, public research accounted for 7% ($59 Bn).[2] The Top 10 countries with the largest industrial bases in 2017 were the United States with $408.4 billion (representing 49% of the whole), followed by France with $69 billion (8.2%), then China with $61.2 billion (7.3%), the United Kingdom with $48.8 billion (5.8%), Germany with $46.2 billion (5.5%), Russia with $27.1 billion (3.2%), Canada with $24 billion (2.9%), Japan with $21 billion (2.5%), Spain with $14 billion (1.7%) and India with $11 billion (1.3%). These ten countries represent $731 billion or 87.2% of the whole industry.[2] In 2018, the new commercial aircraft value is projected for $270.4 billion while business aircraft will amount for $18 billion and civil helicopters for $4 billion.[3] In September 2018, PwC ranked aerospace manufacturing attractiveness: the most attractive country was the United States, with $240 billion in sales in 2017, due to the size of its industry (#1), an educated workforce (#1), low geopolitical risk (#4, #1 is Japan), strong transportation infrastructure (#5, #1 is Hong Kong), a healthy economy (#10, #1 is China), but high costs (#7, #1 is Denmark) and average tax policy (#36, #1 is Qatar). Following were Canada, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.[14] Within the US, the most attractive was Washington state, due to the best Industry (#1), leading Infrastructure (#4, New Jersey is #1) and Economy (#4, Texas is #1), good labor (#9, Massachusetts is #1), average tax policy (#17, Alaska is #1) but is costly (#33, Montana is #1). Washington is tied to Boeing Commercial Airplanes, earning $10.3 billion, is home to 1,400 aerospace-related businesses, and has the highest aerospace jobs concentration. Following are Texas, Georgia, Arizona and Colorado.[14] In the US, the Department of Defense and NASA are the two biggest consumers of aerospace technology and products.[citation needed] The Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States reported that the aerospace industry employed 444,000 wage and salary jobs in 2004, many of which were in Washington and California,[citation needed] this marked a steep decline from the peak years during the Reagan Administration when total employment exceeded 1,000,000 aerospace industry workers.[15] During that period of recovery a special program to restore U.S. competitiveness across all U.S. industries, Project Socrates, contributed to employment growth as the U.S. aerospace industry captured 72 percent of world aerospace market. By 1999 U.S. share of the world market fell to 52 percent. In the European Union, aerospace companies such as Airbus, Safran, BAE Systems, Thales, Dassault, Saab AB, Terma A/S, Patria Plc and Leonardo are participants in the global aerospace industry and research effort. In Russia, large aerospace companies like Oboronprom and the United Aircraft Corporation (encompassing Mikoyan, Sukhoi, Ilyushin, Tupolev, Yakovlev, and Irkut, which includes Beriev) are among the major global players in this industry. Important locations of the civil aerospace industry worldwide include Seattle, Wichita, Kansas, Dayton, Ohio and St. Louis in the United States (Boeing), Montreal and Toronto in Canada (Bombardier, Pratt & Whitney Canada), Toulouse and Bordeaux in France (Airbus, Dassault, ATR), Seville in Spain and Hamburg in Germany (Airbus), the North-West of England and Bristol in Britain (Airbus and AgustaWestland), Komsomolsk-on-Amur and Irkutsk in Russia (Sukhoi, Beriev), Kyiv and Kharkiv in Ukraine (Antonov), Nagoya in Japan (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Aerospace and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Aerospace), as well as São José dos Campos in Brazil where Embraer is based.[16] Several consolidations took place in the aerospace and defense industries over the last few decades. Airbus prominently illustrated the European airliner manufacturing consolidation in the late 1960s.[17] Between 1988 and 2010, more than 5,452 mergers and acquisitions with a total known-value of US$579 billion were announced worldwide.[18] In 1993, then United States Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and his deputy William J. Perry held the \"Last Supper\" at the Pentagon with contractors executives who were told that there were twice as many military suppliers as he wanted to see: $55 billion in military–industry mergers took place from 1992 to 1997, leaving mainly Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon.[19] Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas for US$13.3 billion in 1996.[20] Raytheon acquired Hughes Aircraft Company for $9.5 billion in 1997.[21] BAE Systems is the successor company to numerous British aircraft manufacturers which merged throughout the second half of the 20th century. Many of these mergers followed the 1957 Defence White Paper.[citation needed] Marconi Electronic Systems, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, was acquired by British Aerospace for US$12.3 billion in 1999 merger,[22] to form BAE Systems. In 2002, when Fairchild Dornier was bankrupt, Airbus, Boeing or Bombardier declined to take the 728JET/928JET large regional jet program as mainline and regional aircraft manufacturers were split and Airbus was digesting its ill-fated Fokker acquisition a decade earlier.[17] On September 4, 2017, United Technologies acquired Rockwell Collins in cash and stock for $23 billion, $30 billion including Rockwell Collins' net debt, for $500+ million of synergies expected by year four.[23] The Oct. 16, 2017 announcement of the CSeries partnership between Airbus and Bombardier Aerospace could trigger a daisy chain of reactions towards a new order. Airbus gets a new, efficient model at the lower end of the narrowbody market which provides the bulk of airliner profits and can abandon the slow selling A319 while Bombardier benefits from the growth in this expanded market even if it holds a smaller residual stake. Boeing could forge a similar alliance with either Embraer with its E-jet E2 or Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and its MRJ.[25] On 21 December, Boeing and Embraer confirmed they were discussing a potential merger, with any transaction subject to approval from Brazilian government regulators as well as the companies' boards and shareholders.[26] The weight of Airbus and Boeing could help E2 and CSeries sales but the 100-150 seats market seems slow.[27] As the CSeries, renamed A220, and E-jet E2 are more capable than their predecessors, they moved closer to the lower end of the narrowbodies. In 2018, the four Western airframers combined into two within nine months as Boeing acquired 80% of Embraer's airliners for $3.8 billion on July 5.[17] On April 3, 2020, Raytheon and United Technologies Corporation (except Otis Worldwide, leaving Rockwell Collins and engine maker Pratt and Whitney) merged to form Raytheon Technologies Corporation, with combined sales of $79 billion in 2019.[28] The most prominent unions between 1995 and 2020 include those of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas; the French, German and Spanish parts of EADS; and United Technologies with Rockwell Collins then Raytheon, but many mergers projects did not went through: Textron-Bombardier, EADS-BAE Systems, Hawker Beechcraft-Superior Aviation, GE-Honeywell, BAE Systems-Boeing (or Lockheed Martin), Dassault-Aerospatiale, Safran-Thales, BAE Systems-Rolls-Royce or Lockheed Martin–Northrop Grumman.[29] The largest aerospace suppliers are United Technologies with $28.2 billion of revenue, followed by GE Aerospace with $24.7 billion, Safran with $22.5 billion, Rolls-Royce Holdings with $16.9 billion, Honeywell Aerospace with $15.2 billion and Rockwell Collins including B/E Aerospace with $8.1 billion.[30] Electric aircraft development could generate large changes for the aerospace suppliers.[31] On 26 November 2018, United Technologies announced the completion of its Rockwell Collins acquisition, renaming systems supplier UTC Aerospace Systems as Collins Aerospace, for $23 billion of sales in 2017 and 70,000 employees, and $39.0 billion of sales in 2017 combined with engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.[32] Before the 1980s/1990s, aircraft and aeroengine manufacturers were vertically integrated. Then Douglas aircraft outsourced large aerostructures and the Bombardier Global Express pioneered the \"Tier 1\" supply chain model inspired by automotive industry, with 10-12 risk-sharing limited partners funding around half of the development costs. The Embraer E-Jet followed in the late 1990s with fewer than 40 primary suppliers. Tier 1 suppliers were led by Honeywell, Safran, Goodrich Corporation and Hamilton Sundstrand.[33] In the 2000s, Rolls-Royce reduced its supplier count after bringing in automotive supply chain executives. On the Airbus A380, less than 100 major suppliers outsource 60% of its value, even 80% on the A350. Boeing embraced an aggressive Tier 1 model for the 787 but with its difficulties began to question why it was earning lower margins than its suppliers while it seemed to take all the risk, ensuing its 2011 Partnering for Success initiative, as Airbus initiated its own Scope+ initiative for the A320. Tier 1 consolidation also affects engine manufacturers : GE Aerospace acquired Avio in 2013 and Rolls-Royce took control of ITP Aero.[33]"}

As a product of the United States Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, the aircraft was designed as an air superiority fighter, but also incorporates ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities. The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22 airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while program partner Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems. First flown in 1997, the F-22 descended from the Lockheed YF-22 and was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A. It replaced the F-15 Eagle in most active duty U.S. Air Force (USAF) squadrons. Although the service had originally planned to buy a total of 750 ATFs to replace its entire F-15 fleet, it later scaled down to 381 and the program was ultimately cut to 195 aircraft – 187 of them operational models – in 2009 due to political opposition from high costs, a perceived lack of air-to-air threats at the time of production, and the development of the more affordable and versatile F-35 Lightning II.[N 2] The last aircraft was delivered in 2012. The F-22 is a critical component of the USAF's tactical airpower as its most advanced air superiority fighter. While it had a protracted development and initial operational difficulties, the aircraft became the service's leading counter-air platform. Its deployments include Okinawa, the Middle East, and NATO's eastern flank. Although designed for air superiority operations, the F-22 has also carried out and supported airstrikes in Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, and Venezuela. The F-22 is expected to remain a cornerstone of the USAF's fighter fleet until its successor, the Boeing F-47 enters service around 2030.[3][4] The F-22 originated from the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program that the U.S. Air Force (USAF) initiated in 1981 to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. Intelligence reports indicated that their effectiveness would be eroded by emerging worldwide threats emanating from the Soviet Union, including new developments in surface-to-air missile systems for integrated air defense networks, the introduction of the Beriev A-50 \"Mainstay\" airborne warning and control system (AWACS), and the proliferation of the Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" and Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\" class of fighter aircraft.[5] Code-named \"Senior Sky\", the ATF would become an air superiority fighter program influenced by these threats; in the potential scenario of a Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion in Central Europe, the ATF was envisaged to support the air-land battle by spearheading offensive and defensive counter-air operations (OCA/DCA) in this highly contested environment that would then enable following echelons of NATO strike and attack aircraft to perform air interdiction against ground formations; to do so, the ATF would make an ambitious leap in capability and survivability by taking advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on the horizon, including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight control systems and avionics, more powerful propulsion systems for supersonic cruise (or supercruise) around Mach 1.5, and stealth technology for low observability.[6][7][8] The USAF published an ATF request for information (RFI) to the aerospace industry in May 1981, and following a period of concept and specification development, the ATF System Program Office (SPO) issued the demonstration and validation (Dem/Val) request for proposals (RFP) in September 1985, with requirements placing strong emphasis on stealth, supersonic cruise and maneuver. The RFP saw some alterations after its initial release, including more stringent signature reduction requirements in December 1985 and the addition of the requirement for flying technology demonstrator prototypes in May 1986.[N 3][10] Owing to the immense investments required to develop the advanced technologies, teaming among companies was encouraged. Of the seven bidding companies,[N 4] Lockheed and Northrop were selected on 31 October 1986 as Dem/Val finalists.[N 5] Lockheed, through its Skunk Works division at Burbank, California, teamed with Boeing and General Dynamics while Northrop teamed with McDonnell Douglas. These two contractor teams undertook a 50-month Dem/Val phase to compete for ATF full-scale development, culminating in the flight test of two technology demonstrator prototypes, the Lockheed YF-22 and Northrop YF-23; while they represented competing designs, the prototypes were meant for demonstrating concept viability and risk mitigation rather than a competitive flyoff.[N 6] Concurrently, Pratt & Whitney and General Electric competed for the ATF engines.[14][15] Dem/Val was focused on system engineering, technology development plans, and risk reduction over point aircraft designs; in fact, after down-select, the Lockheed team completely redesigned the airframe configuration in summer 1987 due to weight analysis, with notable changes including the wing planform from swept trapezoidal to diamond-like delta and a reduction in forebody planform area.[16][17] The team extensively used analytical and empirical methods including computational fluid dynamics and computer-aided design, wind tunnel testing (18,000 hours for Dem/Val), and radar cross-section (RCS) calculations and pole testing. Avionics were tested in ground prototypes and flying laboratories.[18] During Dem/Val, the SPO used trade studies from both teams to review the ATF system specifications and adjust or delete requirements that were significant weight and cost drivers while having marginal value. The short takeoff and landing (STOL) requirement was relaxed to delete thrust-reversers, saving substantial weight. Side looking radars and the dedicated infrared search and track (IRST) system were eventually removed as well, although space and cooling provisions were retained to allow for their later addition. The ejection seat was downgraded from a fresh design to the existing ACES II. Despite efforts by both teams to rein in weight, the takeoff gross weight estimates grew from 50,000 to 60,000 lb (22,700 to 27,200 kg), resulting in engine thrust requirement increasing from 30,000 to 35,000 lbf (133 to 156 kN) class.[19] Each team built two prototype air vehicles for Dem/Val, one for each engine option. The YF-22 had its maiden flight on 29 September 1990 and, in testing, successfully demonstrated supercruise, high angle-of-attack maneuvers, and the firing of air-to-air missiles from internal weapons bays. After the flight test of the demonstrator prototypes at Edwards Air Force Base, the teams submitted the results and their full-scale development design proposals – or Preferred System Concept – in December 1990; on 23 April 1991, the Secretary of the USAF, Donald Rice, announced the Lockheed team and Pratt & Whitney as the winners of the ATF and engine competitions.[20] Both designs met or exceeded all performance requirements; the YF-23 was considered stealthier and faster, but the YF-22, with its thrust vectoring nozzles, was more maneuverable as well as less expensive and risky, having flown considerably more test sorties and hours than its counterpart.[21][22] The press also speculated that the Lockheed team's design was more adaptable to the Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF) for replacing the F-14 Tomcat, but by fiscal year (FY) 1992, the U.S. Navy had abandoned NATF due to cost.[23] The program formally moved to full-scale development, or Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD), in August 1991. The production F-22 design (internally designated Configuration 645) had also evolved to have notable differences from the YF-22, which was immature due to being frozen relatively soon after the complete redesign in the summer of 1987.[N 7] While the overall layout was similar, the external geometry saw significant alterations; the wing's leading edge sweep angle was decreased from 48° to 42°, while the vertical stabilizers were shifted rearward and decreased in area by 20%.[25] The radome shape was changed for better radar performance, the wingtips were clipped for antennas, and the dedicated airbrake was eliminated. To improve pilot visibility and aerodynamics, the canopy was moved forward 7 inches (18 cm) and the engine inlets moved rearward 14 inches (36 cm). The shapes of the fuselage, wing, and stabilator trailing edges were refined to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics. The internal structural design was refined and reinforced, with the production airframe designed for a service life of 8,000 hours.[24][26] The revised shaping was validated with over 17,000 additional hours of wind tunnel testing and further RCS testing at Helendale, California and the USAF RATSCAT range before the first flight. Increasing weight during EMD due to demanding ballistic survivability requirements and added capabilities caused slight reductions in projected range and maneuver performance.[27] Aside from advances in air vehicle and propulsion technology, the F-22's avionics were unprecedented in complexity and scale for a combat aircraft, with the integration of multiple sensors systems and antennas, including electronic warfare, communications, identification friend or foe (IFF), and software of 1.7 million lines of code written in Ada. Avionics often became the pacing factor of the whole program. In light of rapidly advancing computing and semiconductor technology, the avionics was to employ the Department of Defense's (DoD) PAVE PILLAR systems architecture and Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) program technology; the computing and processing requirements were equivalent to multiple contemporary Cray supercomputers to achieve sensor fusion.[28][29] To enable early looks and troubleshooting for mission software development, the software was ground-tested in Boeing's Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL) and flight-tested on a Boeing 757 modified with F-22 avionics and sensors, called Flying Test Bed (FTB).[30][31] Because much of the F-22's avionics design occurred in the 1990s as the electronics industry was shifting from military to commercial applications as the predominant market, avionics upgrade efforts was initially difficult and protracted due to changing industry standards; for instance, C/C++ rather than Ada became predominant programming languages.[32][33] The roughly equal division of work amongst the team largely carried through from Dem/Val to EMD, with prime contractor Lockheed responsible for the forward fuselage and control surfaces, General Dynamics for the center fuselage, and Boeing for aft fuselage and wings. Lockheed acquired General Dynamics' fighter portfolio at Fort Worth, Texas in 1993 and thus had the majority of the airframe manufacturing, and merged with Martin Marietta in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin. While Lockheed primarily performed Dem/Val work at its Skunk Works sites in Burbank and Palmdale, California, it shifted its program office and EMD work from Burbank to Marietta, Georgia, where it performed final assembly; Boeing manufactured airframe components, performed avionics integration and developed the training systems in Seattle, Washington. The EMD contract originally ordered seven single-seat F-22As and two twin-seat F-22Bs, although the latter was canceled in 1996 to reduce development costs and the orders were converted to single seaters.[34] The first F-22A, an EMD aircraft with tail number 91-4001, was unveiled at Air Force Plant 6 in Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta on 9 April 1997 where it was officially named \"Raptor\".[N 8] The aircraft first flew on 7 September 1997, piloted by chief test pilot Alfred \"Paul\" Metz.[N 9][36][37] The Raptor's designation was briefly changed to F/A-22 starting in September 2002, mimicking the Navy's F/A-18 Hornet and intended to highlight a planned ground-attack capability amid debate over the aircraft's role and relevance. The F-22 designation was reinstated in December 2005, when the aircraft entered service.[38][39] The F-22 flight test program consisted of flight sciences, developmental test (DT), and initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) by the 411th Flight Test Squadron (FLTS) at Edwards AFB, California, as well as follow-on OT&E and development of tactics and operational employment by the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) at Nellis AFB, Nevada. Nine EMD jets assigned to the 411th FLTS would participate in the test program under the Combined Test Force (CTF) at Edwards. The first two aircraft conducted envelope expansion testing, such as flying qualities, air vehicle performance, propulsion, and stores separation. The third aircraft, the first to have production-level internal structure, tested flight loads, flutter, and stores separation, while two non-flying F-22s were built for testing static loads and fatigue. Subsequent EMD aircraft and the Boeing 757 FTB tested avionics, environmental qualifications, and observables, with the first combat-capable Block 3.0 software flying in 2001.[40] Air vehicle testing resulted in several structural design modifications and retrofits for earlier lots, including tail fin strengthening to resolve buffeting in certain conditions.[41] Raptor 4001 was retired from flight testing in 2000 and subsequently sent to Wright-Patterson AFB for survivability testing, including live fire testing and battle damage repair training.[42] Other retired EMD F-22s were repurposed as maintenance trainers.[43] Because the F-22 had been designed to defeat contemporary and projected Soviet fighters, the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 had major impacts on program funding; the DoD reduced its urgency for new weapon systems and the following years would see successive reductions in its budget. This resulted in the F-22's EMD being rescheduled and lengthened multiple times. Furthermore, the aircraft's sophistication and numerous technological innovations required extensive testing, which exacerbated the cost overruns and delays, especially from mission avionics. Some capabilities were also deferred to post-service upgrades, reducing the upfront cost but increasing total program cost.[44][45] The program transitioned to full-rate production in March 2005 and completed EMD that December, after which the test force had flown 3,496 sorties for over 7,600 flight hours.[42] As the F-22 was designed for upgrades throughout its lifecycle, the 411th FLTS and 422nd TES continued the DT/OT&E and tactics development of these upgrades.[43] Derivatives such as the X-44 thrust vectoring research aircraft and the FB-22 medium-range regional bomber were proposed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, although these were eventually abandoned. In 2006, the F-22 development team won the Collier Trophy, American aviation's most prestigious award.[46] Due to the aircraft's sophisticated capabilities, contractors have been targeted by cyberattacks and technology theft.[47] The USAF originally envisioned ordering 750 ATFs at a total program cost of $44.3 billion and procurement cost of $26.2 billion in FY 1985 dollars, with production beginning in 1994 and service entry in the mid-to-late 1990s. The 1990 Major Aircraft Review (MAR) led by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reduced this to 648 aircraft beginning in 1996 and service entry in the early-to-mid 2000s. After the end of the Cold War, this was further curtailed to 442 in the 1993 Bottom-Up Review while the USAF eventually set its requirement to 381 to support its Air Expeditionary Force structure with the last deliveries in 2013. Throughout development and production, the program was continually scrutinized for its costs and less expensive alternatives such as modernized F-15 or F-16 variants were being proposed, even though the USAF considered the F-22 to provide the greatest capability increase against peer adversaries for the investment.[48] However, funding instability had reduced the total to 339 by 1997 and production was nearly halted by Congress in 1999.[N 10] Although funds were eventually restored, the planned number continued to decline due to delays and cost overruns during EMD, slipping to 277 by 2003.[50][51] In 2004, with its focus on asymmetric counterinsurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan, the DoD under Secretary Donald Rumsfeld further cut procurement to 183 production aircraft, despite the USAF's requirement for 381;[52][53] funding for this number was reached by a multi-year procurement contract awarded in 2006, with aircraft distributed to seven combat squadrons; total program cost was projected to be $62 billion (equivalent to approximately $92.5 billion in 2024).[54] In 2008, the Congressional defense spending bill raised the number to 187.[55][56] F-22 production would support over 1,000 subcontractors and suppliers from 46 states and up to 95,000 jobs, and spanned 15 years at a peak rate of roughly two airplanes per month, about half of the initially planned rate from the 1990 MAR; after EMD aircraft contracts, the first production lot was awarded in September 2000.[57][58][59] As production wound down in 2011, the total program cost was estimated to be about $67.3 billion (about $360 million for each production aircraft delivered), with $32.4 billion spent on Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) and $34.9 billion on procurement and military construction in then year dollars. The incremental cost for an additional F-22 was estimated at $138 million (equivalent to approximately $196 million in 2024) in 2009.[60][61] In total, 195 F-22s were built. The first two were EMD aircraft in the Block 1.0[N 11] configuration for initial flight testing and envelope expansion, while the third was a Block 2.0 aircraft built to represent the internal structure of production airframes and enabled it to test full flight loads. Six more EMD aircraft were built in the Block 10 configuration for development and upgrade testing, with the last two considered essentially production-quality jets. Production for operational squadrons consisted of 74 Block 10/20 training aircraft and 112 Block 30/35 combat aircraft for a total of 186 (or 187 when accounting for Production Representative Test Vehicles and certain EMD jets);[N 1] one of the Block 30 aircraft is dedicated to flight sciences at Edwards AFB.[62][63] By 2020, Block 20 aircraft from Lot 3 onward were upgraded to Block 30 standards under the Common Configuration Plan, increasing the Block 30/35 fleet to 149 aircraft while 37 remained in the Block 20 configuration for training.[N 12][65][66] In order to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of the aircraft's stealth technology and classified capabilities to U.S. adversaries,[67][68] annual DoD appropriations acts since FY1998 have included a provision prohibiting the use of funds made available in each act to approve or license the sale of the F-22 to any foreign government.[69] Customers for U.S. fighters are acquiring earlier designs such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon or the newer F-35 Lightning II, which contains technology from the F-22 but was designed to be cheaper, more flexible, and available for export.[70] In September 2006, Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales.[71] Despite the ban, the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to report on the costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant, and another report on the effect of export sales on the U.S. aerospace industry.[72][73] Some Australian defense officials and politicians have expressed interest in procuring the F-22; in 2008, the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, stated that the aircraft was being considered by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a potential supplement to the F-35.[74][75] Some defense commentators have even advocated for the purchase in lieu of the planned F-35s, citing the F-22's known capabilities and F-35's delays and developmental uncertainties.[76][77][78] However, considerations for the F-22 were later dropped and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet would serve as the RAAF's interim aircraft prior to the F-35's service entry.[79] The Japanese government also showed interest in the F-22. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) would reportedly require fewer fighters for its mission if it obtained the F-22, thus reducing engineering and staffing costs.[80][81] With the end of F-22 production, Japan chose the F-35 in December 2011.[82] At one point the Israeli Air Force had hoped to purchase up to 50 F-22s. In November 2003, however, Israeli representatives announced that after years of analysis and discussions with Lockheed Martin and the DoD, they had concluded that Israel could not afford the aircraft.[83] Israel eventually purchased the F-35.[84][85] Throughout the 2000s when the U.S. was primarily fighting counterinsurgency wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the USAF's requirement for 381 F-22s was questioned over rising costs, initial reliability and availability problems, limited multirole versatility, and a lack of relevant adversaries for air combat missions.[70][86] In 2006, Comptroller General of the United States David Walker found that \"the DoD has not demonstrated the need\" for more investment in the F-22,[87] and further opposition was expressed by Bush Administration Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and his successor Robert Gates, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R. England, and Chairman of U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) Senators John Warner and John McCain.[88][89] Under Rumsfeld, procurement was severely cut to 183 aircraft. The F-22 lost influential supporters in 2008 after the forced resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force General T. Michael Moseley.[90] In November 2008, Gates stated that the F-22 lacked relevance in asymmetric post-Cold War conflicts,[91] and in April 2009, under the Obama Administration, he called for production to end in FY 2011 after completing 187 F-22s.[92] The loss of staunch F-22 advocates in the upper DoD echelons resulted in the erosion of its political support. In July 2008, General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated to the SASC his reasons for supporting the termination of F-22 production, including shifting resources to the multi-service F-35 and the electronic warfare EA-18G Growler.[93] Although Russian and Chinese fighter developments fueled concern for the USAF, Gates dismissed this and in 2010, he set the F-22 requirement to 187 aircraft by lowering the number of major regional conflict preparations from two to one, despite an effort by Wynne's and Moseley's successors Michael Donley and General Norton Schwartz to raise the number to 243; according to Schwartz, he and Donley finally relented in order to convince Gates to preserve the Long Range Strike Bomber program.[94][95] After President Barack Obama threatened to veto further production at Gates' urging, both the Senate and House agreed to abide by the 187 cap in July 2009.[96][97] Gates highlighted the F-35's role in the decision,[98] and believed that the U.S. would maintain its stealth fighter numbers advantage by 2025 even with F-35 delays.[99] In December 2011, the 195th and final F-22 was completed out of 8 test and 187 production aircraft built; the jet was delivered on 2 May 2012.[100][101] After production ended, F-22 tooling and associated documentation were retained and mothballed at the Sierra Army Depot to support repairs and maintenance throughout the fleet life cycle, as well as the possibility of a production restart or a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).[102][103][104] The Marietta plant space was repurposed to support the C-130J and F-35, while engineering work for sustainment and upgrades continued at Fort Worth, Texas and Palmdale, California.[104][105] The curtailed F-22 production forced the USAF to extend the service of 179 F-15C/Ds to 2026—well beyond its planned retirement—to maintain adequate air superiority fighter numbers.[106] In April 2016, Congress directed the USAF to conduct a cost study and assessment associated with resuming production of the F-22, citing advancing threats from Russia and China.[107] On 9 June 2017, the USAF submitted their report stating they had no plans to restart the F-22 production line due to cost-prohibitive economic and logistical challenges; it estimated it would cost approximately $50 billion to procure 194 additional F-22s at a cost of $206–216 million per aircraft, including approximately $9.9 billion for non-recurring start-up costs and $40.4 billion for acquisition with the first delivery in the mid-to-late 2020s. The long gap since the end of production meant hiring new workers, sourcing replacement vendors, and finding new plant space, contributing to the high start-up costs and lead times. The USAF believed that the funding would be better invested in its next-generation Air Superiority 2030 effort, which evolved into the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD).[108][105] Starting in 2019, to replace its aging F-15C/D still remaining in inventory, the USAF procured a number of new-build F-15EX, which minimized start-up costs by using an active export production line.[109] The F-22 and its subsystems were designed to be upgraded over its life cycle via numbered Increments[N 13] and Operational Flight Program (OFP) updates in anticipation for technological advances and evolving threats, although this initially proved difficult and costly due to the highly integrated avionics systems architecture.[110] Amid debates over the airplane's relevance in asymmetric counterinsurgency warfare, the first upgrades primarily focused on ground attack, or strike capabilities. Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) employment was added with Increment 2 in 2005 and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) was integrated with 3.1 in 2011; the improved AN/APG-77(V)1 radar, which incorporates air-to-ground modes, was certified in March 2007 and fitted on airframes from Lot 5 onward.[N 14][112][113] To address oxygen deprivation issues, F-22s were fitted with an automatic backup oxygen system (ABOS) and modified life support system starting in 2012.[114] In contrast to prior upgrades, Increment 3.2 emphasized air combat capabilities with updates to electronic warfare, CNI (including Link 16 receive), and geolocation as well as AIM-9X and AIM-120D integration.[115] Fleet releases of the two-part process began in 2013 and 2019 respectively. Concurrently, OFP updates added Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System, cryptographic enhancements, and improved avionics stability, among others.[116][117] A MIDS-JTRS terminal, which includes Mode 5 IFF and Link 16 transmit/receive capability, was installed starting in 2021.[118][32] To address obsolescence and modernization difficulties, the F-22's mission computers were upgraded in 2021 with military-hardened commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) open mission system (OMS) processor modules with a modular open systems architecture (MOSA). Agile software development process in conjunction with an orchestration system was implemented to enable faster upgrades from additional vendors, and software updates shifted away from Increments developed using the waterfall model to numbered annual releases.[119][120] Additional upgrades being tested include new sensors and antennas, integration of new weapons including the AIM-260 JATM, and reliability improvements such as more durable stealth coatings; the dedicated infrared search and track (IRST), originally deleted during Dem/Val, is one of the sensors added.[121][122][123] Other developments include all-aspect IRST functionality for the Missile Launch Detector (MLD),[N 15] manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) capability with uncrewed collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) or \"loyal wingmen\", and integration of the Gentex/Raytheon (later Thales USA) Scorpion helmet-mounted display (HMD).[N 16][32][125] To preserve the aircraft's stealth while enabling additional payload and fuel capacity, stealthy external carriage has been investigated since the early-2000s, with a low drag, low-observable external tank and pylon under development to increase stealthy combat radius.[126] The F-22 has also been used a platform to test and apply technologies from the NGAD program.[127] Not all proposed upgrades have been implemented. The planned Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) integration was cut due to development delays and lack of proliferation. While Block 20 aircraft from Lot 3 onwards have been upgraded to Block 30/35 under the Common Configuration Plan, Lockheed Martin in 2017 had also proposed upgrading all remaining Block 20 training aircraft to Block 30/35 as well to increase numbers available for combat; this was not pursued due to other budget priorities.[66] Aside from modernizations, the F-22's structural design and construction was improved over the course of the production run; for instance, aircraft from Lot 3 onwards had improved stabilators built by Vought.[128][129] The fleet underwent a $350 million \"structures repair/retrofit program\" (SRP) to resolve problems identified during testing as well as address improper titanium heat treatment in the parts of early batches.[130][41] By January 2021, all aircraft had gone through the SRP to ensure full service lives for the entire fleet.[131][132] The F-22 has also been used to test and qualify alternative fuels, including a synthetic jet fuel consisting of 50/50 mix of JP-8 and a Fischer–Tropsch process-produced, natural gas-based fuel in August 2008, and a 50% mixture of biofuel derived from camelina in March 2011.[133][134] The F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation air superiority fighter that is considered fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF.[135] It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and integrated avionics (or sensor fusion) in a single weapons platform to enable it to survive and conduct missions, primarily offensive and defensive counter-air operations, in highly contested environments.[38] The F-22's shape combines stealth and aerodynamic performance. Planform and panel edges are aligned at common angular aspects and the surfaces, also aligned accordingly, have continuous curvature to minimize the aircraft's radar cross-section.[136] Its clipped diamond-like delta wings have the leading edge swept 42°, trailing edge swept −17°, a slight anhedral and a conical camber to reduce supersonic wave drag. The shoulder-mounted wings are smoothly blended into the fuselage with four empennage surfaces and leading edge root extensions running to the caret inlets' upper edges, where the forebody chines also meet. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails (stabilators); for air braking, the ailerons deflect up, flaperons down, and rudders outwards to increase drag.[137][30] Owing to the focus on supersonic performance, area rule is applied extensively to the airplane's shape and nearly all of the fuselage volume lies ahead of the wing's trailing edge to reduce drag at supersonic speeds, with the stabilators pivoting from tail booms extending aft of the engine nozzles.[138] Weapons are carried internally in the fuselage for stealth. The jet has a retractable tricycle landing gear and an emergency tailhook.[30] Fire suppression system and fuel tank inerting system are installed for survivability.[139][140] The aircraft's dual Pratt & Whitney F119 augmented turbofan engines are closely spaced and incorporate rectangular two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzles with a range of ±20 degrees in the pitch-axis; the nozzles are fully integrated into the F-22's flight controls and vehicle management system. Each engine has dual-redundant Hamilton Standard full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) and maximum thrust in the 35,000 lbf (156 kN) class. The F-22's thrust-to-weight ratio at typical combat weight is nearly at unity in maximum military power and 1.25 in full afterburner. The fixed shoulder-mounted caret inlets are offset from the forward fuselage to bypass the turbulent boundary layer and generate oblique shocks with the upper inboard corners to ensure good total pressure recovery and efficient supersonic flow compression.[141] Maximum speed without external stores is approximately Mach 1.8 in supercruise at military/intermediate power and greater than Mach 2 with afterburners.[N 17] With 18,000 lb (8,165 kg) of internal fuel and an additional 8,000 lb (3,629 kg) in two 600-gallon external tanks, the jet has a ferry range of over 1,600 nmi (1,840 mi; 2,960 km).[144] The aircraft has a refueling boom receptacle centered on its spine and an auxiliary power unit embedded in the left wing root.[145] The F-22's high cruise speed and operating altitude over prior fighters improve the effectiveness of its sensors and weapon systems, and increase survivability against ground defenses such as surface-to-air missiles.[146][147] Its ability to supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using afterburners, allows it to intercept targets that afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach. The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured fighters due to a lack of parasitic drag from external stores.[148] The F-22's thrust and aerodynamics enable regular combat speeds of Mach 1.5 at 50,000 feet (15,000 m), thus providing 50% greater employment range for air-to-air missiles and twice the effective range for JDAMs than with prior platforms.[N 18][150][151] Its structure contains a significant amount of high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively, titanium alloys and bismaleimide/epoxy composites comprise 42% and 24% of the structural weight; the materials and multiple load path structural design also enable good ballistic survivability.[N 19][152][153] The airplane's aerodynamics, relaxed stability, and powerful thrust-vectoring engines give it excellent maneuverability and energy potential across its flight envelope, capable of 9-g maneuvers at takeoff gross weight with full internal fuel.[143] Its large control surfaces, vortex-generating chines and LERX, and vectoring nozzles provide excellent high alpha (angle of attack) characteristics, and is capable of flying at trimmed alpha of over 60° while maintaining roll control and performing maneuvers such as the Herbst maneuver (J-turn) and Pugachev's Cobra;[154] vortex impingement on the vertical tail fins did cause more buffeting than initially anticipated, resulting in the strengthening of the fin structure by changing the rear spar from composite to titanium.[155][156] The computerized triplex-redundant fly-by-wire control system and FADEC make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable, thus giving the pilot carefree handling.[157][148] The F-22 was designed to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar, with radio waves reflected, scattered, or diffracted away from the emitter source towards specific sectors, or absorbed and attenuated. Measures to reduce RCS include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges and continuous curvature of surfaces, internal carriage of weapons, fixed-geometry serpentine inlet ducts and curved vanes that prevent line-of-sight of the engine fan faces and turbines from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return.[136] The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio frequency emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye.[158] The aircraft's rectangular thrust-vectoring nozzles flatten the exhaust plume and facilitate its mixing with ambient air through shed vortices, which reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing (\"heat seeking\") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles.[159][160] Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special topcoat and active cooling to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.[161][136] Compared to previous stealth designs, the F-22 is less reliant on RAM, which are maintenance-intensive and susceptible to adverse weather conditions, and can undergo repairs on the flight line or in a normal hangar without climate control. The F-22 incorporates a Signature Assessment System which delivers warnings when the radar signature is degraded and necessitates repair.[154] While the F-22's exact RCS is classified, in 2009 Lockheed Martin released information indicating that from certain angles the airplane has an RCS of 0.0001 m2 or −40 dBsm – equivalent to the radar reflection of a \"steel marble\"; the aircraft can mount a Luneburg lens reflector to mask its RCS.[162][163] For missions where stealth is required, the mission capable rate is 62–70%.[N 20] Beginning in 2021, the F-22 has been seen testing a new chrome-like surface coating, speculated to help reduce the F-22's detectability by infrared tracking systems.[165][166] The effectiveness of the stealth characteristics is difficult to gauge. The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of the aircraft's frontal or side area from the perspective of a static radar. When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a completely different set of angles and surface area, potentially increasing radar observability. Furthermore, the F-22's stealth contouring and radar-absorbent materials are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars such as weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the F-22 due to its physical size. These are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and have low precision.[167] Additionally, while faint or fleeting radar contacts make defenders aware that a stealth aircraft is present, reliably vectoring interception to attack the aircraft is much more challenging.[168][169] The aircraft has an integrated avionics system where through sensor fusion, data from all onboard sensor systems as well as off-board inputs are filtered and processed into a combined tactical picture, thus enhancing the pilot's situational awareness and reducing workload. Key mission systems include Sanders/General Electric AN/ALR-94 electronic warfare system, Martin Marietta AN/AAR-56 infrared and ultraviolet Missile Launch Detector (MLD), Westinghouse/Texas Instruments AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, TRW AN/ASQ-220 Communication/Navigation/Identification (CNI) suite, and Raytheon advanced infrared search and track (IRST) being tested.[170][171][172] The APG-77 radar has a low-observable, active-aperture, electronically scanned antenna with multiple target track-while-scan in all weather conditions; the antenna is tilted back for stealth. Its emissions can be focused to overload enemy sensors as an electronic attack capability. The radar changes frequencies more than 1,000 times per second to lower interception probability and has an estimated range of 125–150 mi (201–241 km) against an 11 sq ft (1 m2) target and 250 mi (400 km) or more in narrow beams. The upgraded APG-77(V)1 provides air-to-ground functionality through synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mapping, ground moving target indication/track (GMTI/GMTT), and strike modes.[112][154] The ALR-94 electronic warfare system, among the most technically complex equipment on the F-22, integrates more than 30 antennas blended into the wings and fuselage for all-round radar warning receiver (RWR) coverage and threat geolocation. It can be used as a passive detector capable of searching targets at ranges (250+ nmi) exceeding the radar's, and can provide enough information for a target lock through narrowband interleaved search-and-rack (NBILST) and cue radar emissions to a narrow beam (down to 2° by 2° in azimuth and elevation). Depending on the detected threat, the defensive systems can prompt the pilot to release countermeasures such as flares or chaff.[173] To ensure stealth in the radio frequency spectrum, the ASQ-220 CNI emissions are strictly controlled and confined to specific sectors, with tactical communication between F-22s performed using the directional Inter/Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL). The CNI system also manages TACAN, IFF (including Mode 5), and communication through various methods such as HAVE QUICK/SATURN, SINCGARS, and later Link 16.[174][175] Additional passive detection methods include the AAR-56 Missile Launch Detector, which uses six sensors to provide full spherical infrared coverage; the sensors are being updated to the TacIRST for improved detection and survivability measures. Separately, the advanced IRST, housed in a stealthy wing pod, is a narrow field-of-view sensor for long-range passive identification and targeting.[176] The aircraft was also upgraded with an automatic ground collision avoidance system (GCAS).[177] Information from radar, CNI, and other sensors are processed by two Hughes Common Integrated Processor (CIP) mission computers, each capable of processing up to 10.5 billion instructions per second.[173][178] The F-22's baseline software has some 1.7 million lines of code, the majority involving the mission systems such as processing radar data.[179] The highly integrated nature of the avionics architecture system, as well as the use of the programming language Ada,[N 21] has made the development and testing of upgrades challenging. To enable more rapid upgrades, the CIPs were upgraded with Curtiss-Wright open mission systems (OMS) processor modules as well as a modular open systems architecture called the Open Systems Enclave (OSE) orchestration platform to allow the avionics suite to interface with containerized software from third-party vendors.[32][181] The F-22's ability to operate close to the battlefield gives the aircraft threat detection and identification capability comparative with the RC-135 Rivet Joint, and the ability to function as a \"mini-AWACS\", though its radar is less powerful than those of dedicated platforms. This allows the F-22 to rapidly designate targets for allies and coordinate friendly aircraft.[154][182] Although communication with other aircraft types was initially limited to voice, upgrades have enabled data to be transferred through a Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) or via JTIDS/Link 16 traffic through MIDS-JTRS.[118] The IEEE 1394B bus developed for the F-22 was derived from the commercial IEEE 1394 \"FireWire\" bus system.[183] In 2007, the F-22's radar was tested as a wireless data transceiver, transmitting data at 548 megabits per second and receiving at gigabit speed, far faster than the Link 16 system.[184] The aircraft's radio frequency receivers provide electronic support measures (ESM) and the ability to perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) tasks.[185][186] The F-22 has a glass cockpit with all-digital flight instruments. The monochrome head-up display offers a wide field of view and serves as a primary flight instrument; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels.[187] The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles. The USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky and was abandoned.[188] The canopy's dimensions are approximately 140 inches long, 45 inches wide, and 27 inches tall (355 cm × 115 cm × 69 cm) and weighs 360 pounds.[189] The canopy was redesigned after the original design lasted an average of 331 hours instead of the required 800 hours. Although the F-22 was originally intended to have a helmet mounted display (HMD), this was deferred during development to save costs; the aircraft is currently integrating the Scorpion HMD.[86] The F-22 has integrated radio functionality, the signal processing systems are virtualized rather than as a separate hardware module.[190] The integrated control panel (ICP) is a keypad system for entering communications, navigation, and autopilot data. Two 3 in × 4 in (7.6 cm × 10.2 cm) up-front displays located around the ICP are used to display integrated caution advisory/warning (ICAW) data, CNI data and also serve as the stand-by flight instrumentation group and fuel quantity indicator for redundancy.[191] The stand-by flight group displays an artificial horizon, for basic instrument meteorological conditions. The 8 in × 8 in (20 cm × 20 cm) primary multi-function display (PMFD) is located under the ICP, and is used for navigation and situation assessment. Three 6.25 in × 6.25 in (15.9 cm × 15.9 cm) secondary multi-function displays are located around the PMFD for tactical information and stores management.[192] The ejection seat is a version of the ACES II commonly used in USAF aircraft, with a center-mounted ejection control.[193] The F-22 has a complex life support system, which includes the onboard oxygen generation system (OBOGS), protective pilot garments, and a breathing regulator/anti-g (BRAG) valve controlling flow and pressure to the pilot's mask and garments. The pilot garments were developed under the Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit (ATAGS) project and protect against chemical/biological hazards and cold-water immersion, counter g-forces and low pressure at high altitudes, and provide thermal relief.[194] Following a series of hypoxia-related issues, the life support system was consequently revised to include an automatic backup oxygen system and a new flight vest valve.[114] In combat environments, the ejection seat includes a modified M4 carbine designated the GAU-5/A.[195] The F-22 has three internal weapons bays: a large main bay on the bottom of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine inlets; a small bay for countermeasures such as flares is located behind each side bay.[196] The main bay is split along the centerline and can accommodate six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and each side bay has an LAU-141/A launcher for short-range missiles. The primary air-to-air missiles are the AIM-120 AMRAAM and the AIM-9 Sidewinder, with planned integration of the AIM-260 JATM.[197] Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less than a second, during which pneumatic or hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft; this is to reduce vulnerability to detection and to deploy missiles during high-speed flight.[198] An internally mounted M61A2 Vulcan 20 mm rotary cannon is embedded in the airplane's right wing root with the muzzle covered by a retractable door, which remains closed when the cannon is not firing in order to minimize the negative effect the exposed muzzle on the aircraft's radar signature[199] The radar projection of the cannon fire's path is displayed on the pilot's head-up display.[200] Although designed for air-to-air missiles, the main bay can replace four launchers with two bomb racks that can each carry one 1,000 lb (450 kg) or four 250 lb (110 kg) bombs for a total of 2,000 pounds (910 kg) of air-to-surface ordnance.[201][38] In 2024, Lockheed Martin disclosed its proposed Mako hypersonic missile, a 1,300 lb (590 kg) weapon that can be carried internally in the F-22.[202] While capable of carrying weapons with GPS guidance such as JDAMs and SDBs, the F-22 cannot self-designate laser-guided weapons.[203] While the F-22 typically carries weapons internally, the wings include four hardpoints, each rated to handle 5,000 lb (2,300 kg). Each hardpoint can accommodate a pylon that can carry a detachable 600-gallon (2,270 L) external fuel tank or a launcher holding two air-to-air missiles; the two inboard hardpoints are \"plumbed\" for external fuel tanks. The two outboard hardpoints have since been dedicated to a pair of stealthy pods housing the IRST and mission systems. The aircraft can jettison external tanks and their pylon attachments to restore its low observable characteristics and kinematic performance.[204] Each F-22 requires a three-week packaged maintenance plan (PMP) every 300 flight hours.[205] Its stealth coatings were designed to be more robust and weather-resistant than those of earlier stealth aircraft,[154] yet early coatings failed against rain and moisture when F-22s were initially posted to Guam in 2009.[206] Stealth measures account for almost one third of maintenance, with coatings being particularly demanding.[207][32] F-22 depot maintenance is performed at Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill AFB, Utah; considerable care is taken during maintenance due to the small fleet size and limited attrition reserve.[208] F-22s were available for missions 63% of the time on average in 2015, up from 40% when it was introduced in 2005. Maintenance hours per flight hour was also improved from 30 early on to 10.5 by 2009, lower than the requirement of 12; man-hours per flight hour was 43 in 2014. When introduced, the F-22 had a Mean Time Between Maintenance (MTBM) of 1.7 hours, short of the required 3.0; this rose to 3.2 hours in 2012.[86][41] By fiscal year 2015, the cost per flight hour was $59,116, while the user reimbursement rate was approximately US$35,000 (~$42,237 in 2024) per flight hour in 2019.[209][210] The F-22 underwent extensive testing before its service introduction. While the first production aircraft was delivered to Edwards AFB in October 2002 for IOT&E and the first jet for the 422nd TES at Nellis AFB arrived in January 2003, IOT&E was continually pushed back from its planned start in mid-2003, with mission avionics stability being particularly challenging.[N 22][155] Following a preliminary assessment, called OT&E Phase 1, formal IOT&E began in April 2004 and was completed in December of that year. This milestone marked the successful demonstration of the jet's air-to-air mission capability, although the jet was more maintenance intensive than expected.[211] A Follow-On OT&E (FOT&E) in 2005 cleared the F-22's air-to-ground mission capability.[212] The first combat ready F-22 of the 1st Fighter Wing arrived at Langley AFB, Virginia in January 2005 and that December, the USAF announced that the aircraft had achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) with the 94th Fighter Squadron.[213] The unit subsequently participated in Exercise Northern Edge 06 in Alaska in June 2006 and Exercise Red Flag 07–2 at Nellis AFB in February 2007, where it demonstrated the F-22's greatly increased air combat capabilities when flying against Red Force Aggressor F-15s and F-16s with a simulated kill ratio of 108–0. These large force exercises also further refined the F-22's operational tactics and employment.[54][214] The F-22 achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC) in December 2007, when General John Corley of Air Combat Command (ACC) officially declared the F-22s of the integrated active duty 1st Fighter Wing and Virginia Air National Guard 192nd Fighter Wing fully operational.[215] This was followed by an Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI) of the integrated wing in April 2008, in which it was rated \"excellent\" in all categories, with a simulated kill-ratio of 221–0.[216] The fielding of the F-22 with its precision strike capability also contributed to the retirement of the F-117 from operational service in 2008, with the 49th Fighter Wing operating the F-22 for a brief period prior to a series of fleet consolidations to reduce long term operational costs;[217] further consolidations to improve availability and pilot training were recommended by the Government Accountability Office in 2018.[218] The 43rd Fighter Squadron was reactivated in 2002 as the F-22 Formal Training Unit (FTU) for the type's basic course at Tyndall AFB and the first aircraft for pilot training was delivered in September 2003. Following severe damage to the installation in the wake of Hurricane Michael in 2018, the squadron and its aircraft were relocated to nearby Eglin AFB; although it was initially feared that several jets were lost due to storm damage, all were later repaired and flown out.[219] The FTU and its aircraft were reassigned to the 71st Fighter Squadron at Langley AFB in 2023.[220] As of 2014, B-Course students require 38 sorties to graduate (previously 43 sorties). Track 1 course pilots, pilots retraining from other aircraft, also saw a reduction in the number of sorties needed to graduate, from 19 to 12 sorties.[221] F-22 students are first trained on the T-38 Talon trainer aircraft. Additional pilot training takes place on the F-16 because the aging T-38 is not rated to sustain higher G-forces and lacks modern avionics.[222] Due to a lack of a modern trainer stand-in that can accurately emulate the F-22, the Air Force often uses F-22s to supplement training, which is costly as the F-22 costs almost 10 times more than the T-38 per flight hour.[223] The upcoming T-7 Red Hawk features modern avionics that better approximate those of the F-22 and F-35.[224] This is scheduled to enter initial operating capability in 2027, several years behind schedule.[225] In 2014 the Air Force stood up the 2nd Fighter Training Squadron at Tyndall AFB which was equipped with T-38s to serve as adversary aircraft to reduce adversary training flights on the F-22s.[226] To reduce operating costs and prolong the F-22's service life, some pilot training sorties are performed using flight simulators.[205] The advanced F-22 weapons instructor course at USAF Weapons School is conducted by the 433rd Weapons Squadron at Nellis AFB.[227] During the initial years of service, F-22 pilots experienced symptoms as a result of oxygen system issues that include loss of consciousness, memory loss, emotional lability and neurological changes as well as lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; the issues resulted in a fatal mishap in 2010 and four-month grounding in 2011 and subsequent altitude and distance flight restrictions.[228][229] In August 2012, the DoD found that the BRAG valve, which inflated the pilot's vest at high-g, was defective and restricted breathing and the OBOGS (onboard oxygen generation system) unexpectedly fluctuated oxygen supply at high g.[230][231] In 2005, the Raptor Aeromedical Working Group had recommended oxygen system changes that were unfunded, but received reconsideration in 2012.[232][233] The F-22 CTF and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron eventually determined breathing restrictions as the root cause; coughing symptoms were attributed to acceleration atelectasis[N 23] from high g exposure and OBOGS delivering excessive oxygen concentration. The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed unrelated.[234] Modifications to the life support and oxygen systems, including the installation of an automatic backup, allowed altitude and distance restrictions to be lifted in April 2013.[235] Following IOC and large-scale exercises, the F-22 flew its first homeland defense mission in January 2007 under Operation Noble Eagle. In November 2007, F-22s of 90th Fighter Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, performed their first North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) interception of two Russian Tu-95MS bombers.[236] Since then, F-22s have also escorted probing Tu-160 bombers.[237] The F-22 was first deployed overseas in February 2007 with the 27th Fighter Squadron to Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan.[238] This first overseas deployment was initially marred by problems when six F-22s flying from Hickam AFB, Hawaii, experienced multiple software-related system failures while crossing the International Date Line (180th meridian of longitude). The aircraft returned to Hawaii by following tanker aircraft. Within 48 hours, the error was resolved and the journey resumed.[239][240] Kadena would be a frequent rotation for F-22 units; they have also been involved in training exercises in South Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines.[241][242][243] Defense Secretary Gates initially refused to deploy F-22s to the Middle East in 2007;[244] the type made its first deployment in the region at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE in 2009. In April 2012, F-22s have been rotating into Al Dhafra, less than 200 miles from Iran.[245][246] In March 2013, the USAF announced that an F-22 had intercepted an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that approached within 16 miles of an MQ-1 Predator flying off the Iranian coastline.[247] On 22 September 2014, F-22s performed the type's first combat sorties by conducting some of the opening strikes of Operation Inherent Resolve, the American-led intervention in Syria; aircraft dropped 1,000-pound GPS-guided bombs on Islamic State targets near Tishrin Dam.[248][249] Between September 2014 and July 2015, F-22s flew 204 sorties over Syria, dropping 270 bombs at some 60 locations.[250] Throughout their deployment, F-22s conducted close air support (CAS) and also deterred Syrian, Iranian, and Russian aircraft from attacking U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and disrupting U.S. operations in the region.[251][252][253] F-22s also participated in the U.S. strikes that defeated pro-Assad and Russian Wagner Group paramilitary forces near Khasham in eastern Syria on 7 February 2018.[254][255][256] These strikes notwithstanding, the F-22's main role in the operation was conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.[257] The aircraft also performed missions in other regions of the Middle East; in November 2017, F-22s operating alongside B-52s bombed opium production and storage facilities in Taliban-controlled regions of Afghanistan.[258][209] To increase deployment responsiveness and reduce logistical footprint in a peer or near-peer conflict, the USAF developed a deployment concept called Rapid Raptor which involves two to four F-22s and one C-17 for logistical support, first proposed in 2008 by two F-22 pilots. The goal was for the type to be able to set up and engage in combat within 24 hours in smaller and more austere environments that would enable more dispersed and survivable disposition of forces. This concept was tested at Wake Island in 2013 and Guam in late 2014.[259][260][261] Four F-22s were deployed to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany, Łask Air Base in Poland, and Ämari Air Base in Estonia in August and September 2015 to further test the concept and train with NATO allies in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.[262] The USAF would build on the principles of Rapid Raptor and eventually integrate it into its new operational concept called Agile Combat Employment, which shifts towards distributed operations during peer conflicts; for instance, detachments of F-22s have operated from austere airfields on Tinian and Iwo Jima during exercises.[263][264] On 4 February 2023, an F-22 of the 1st Fighter Wing shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon within visual range off the coast of South Carolina at an altitude of 60,000 to 65,000 feet (20,000 m),[265] marking the F-22's first air-to-air kill.[266] The wreckage landed approximately 6 miles offshore and was subsequently secured by ships of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard.[267] F-22s shot down additional high-altitude objects near the coast of Alaska on 10 February and over Yukon on 11 February.[268] The USAF expects to begin retiring the F-22 in the 2030s as it gets replaced by the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) sixth-generation crewed fighter, the Boeing F-47.[269][270][271][272] In May 2021, Air Force Chief of Staff Charles Q. Brown Jr. said that he envisioned a reduction in the future number of fighter fleets to \"four plus one\": the F-22 followed by NGAD, the F-35A, the F-15E followed by F-15EX, the F-16 followed by \"MR-X\", and the A-10; the A-10 was later dropped from the plans due to that aircraft's accelerated retirement.[273][274] In 2022 the Air Force requested that it be allowed to divest all but three of its Block 20 F-22s at Tyndall AFB.[275] Congress denied the request to divest its 33 non-combat-coded Block 20 aircraft and passed language prohibiting the divestment through FY2026.[276] While the Block 30/35 F-22 remains one of the USAF's top priorities and will be continually updated, the service believes the Block 20 aircraft is obsolescent and unsuitable even for training F-22 pilots and that upgrading them to Block 30/35 standards would be cost-prohibitive at $3.5 billion.[277][278] In September of 2025, Lockheed Martin revealed plans to modify 35 Block 20 F-22s, used for training purposes, to combat ready Block 30/35 F-22s.[279] According to US officials, F-22s and F-35As launched from land bases in the Middle East, were used to attempt to draw surface-to-air missile fire ahead of B-2 bombing runs during the United States strikes on Iranian nuclear sites on 22 June 2025.[280][281][282] In January 2026, F-22s along with F-35s, B-1s, F/A-18s, E/A-18s alongside various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft; and numerous drones were used to dismantle and disable the air defense systems in Venezuela to ensure the safe passage of the helicopters into the target area. The operation resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.[283] The X-44 MANTA, or multi-axis, no-tail aircraft, was a planned experimental aircraft based on the F-22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup.[286] The aircraft was to be solely controlled by thrust vectoring, without featuring any rudders, ailerons, or elevators. Funding for this program was halted in 2000.[287] The FB-22 was proposed in the early 2000s as a supersonic stealth regional bomber for the USAF.[288] The design went through several iterations and the later ones would combine an F-22 fuselage with greatly enlarged delta wings and was projected to carry up to 30 Small Diameter Bombs to over 1,600 nmi (3,000 km), about twice the combat range of the F-22A.[289] The FB-22 proposals were cancelled with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments, in lieu of a larger subsonic strategic bomber with a much greater range; this became the Next-Generation Bomber, although it would be rescoped in 2009 as the Long Range Strike Bomber resulting in the B-21 Raider.[126][290][291] In August 2018, Lockheed Martin proposed an F-22 derivative to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) for its 5th/6th generation F-X program. The design, which was later also proposed to the USAF, would combine a modified F-22 airframe with enlarged wings to increase fuel capacity and combat radius to 1,200 nmi (2,200 km) as well as the avionics and improved stealth coatings of the F-35.[292][293] The proposal was ultimately not considered by the USAF or JASDF due to cost as well as existing export restrictions and industrial workshare concerns.[294][295] The United States Air Force is the only operator of the F-22. As of August 2022, it has 178 active aircraft in its inventory.[296][38] Current units are bolded. The first F-22 crash occurred during takeoff at Nellis AFB on 20 December 2004, in which the pilot ejected safely before impact.[303] The investigation revealed that a brief interruption in power during an engine shutdown prior to flight caused a flight-control system malfunction;[304] consequently the aircraft design was corrected to avoid the problem. Following a brief grounding, F-22 operations resumed after a review.[305] On 25 March 2009, an EMD F-22 crashed 35 miles (56 km) northeast of Edwards AFB during a test flight, resulting in the death of Lockheed Martin test pilot David P. Cooley. An Air Force Materiel Command investigation found that Cooley momentarily lost consciousness during a high-G maneuver, or g-LOC, then ejected when he found himself too low to recover. Cooley was killed during ejection by blunt-force trauma from windblast due to the aircraft's speed. The investigation found no design issues.[306][307] On 16 November 2010, an F-22 from Elmendorf AFB crashed, killing the pilot, Captain Jeffrey Haney. F-22s were restricted to flying below 25,000 feet, then grounded during the investigation.[308] The crash was attributed to a bleed air system malfunction after an engine overheat condition was detected, shutting down the Environmental Control System (ECS) and OBOGS. The accident review board ruled Haney was to blame, as he did not react properly to engage the emergency oxygen system.[309] Haney's widow sued Lockheed Martin, claiming equipment defects, and later reached a settlement.[310][234] After the ruling, the emergency oxygen system engagement handle was redesigned and the entire system was eventually replaced by an automatic backup.[311][312] On 11 February 2013, the DoD's Inspector General released a report stating that the USAF had erred in blaming Haney, and that facts did not sufficiently support conclusions; the USAF stated that it stood by the ruling.[313] On 15 November 2012, an F-22 crashed to the east of Tyndall AFB during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely and no injuries were reported on the ground.[314] The investigation determined that a \"chafed\" electrical wire ignited the fluid in a hydraulic line, causing a fire that damaged the flight controls.[315] On 15 May 2020, an F-22 from Eglin Air Force Base crashed during a routine training mission shortly after takeoff; the pilot ejected safely. The cause of the crash was attributed to a maintenance error after an aircraft wash resulting in faulty air data sensor readings.[316] Data from USAF,[38] manufacturers' data,[319][320][321] Aerofax,[322] Aviation Week,[154][323] Air Forces Monthly,[144] and Journal of Electronic Defense[175] General characteristics Performance Armament Avionics Related development Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists"}

A multirole combat aircraft designed for both air superiority and strike missions, it also has electronic warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. Lockheed Martin is the prime F-35 contractor with principal partners Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems. The aircraft has three main variants: the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) F-35A, the short take-off and vertical-landing (STOVL) F-35B, and the carrier variant (CV) catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) F-35C. The aircraft descends from the Lockheed Martin X-35, which in 2001 beat the Boeing X-32 to win the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program intended to replace the F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Hornet, and the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II \"jump jet\", among others. Its development is primarily funded by the United States, with additional funding from program partner countries from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and close U.S. allies, including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom, and formerly Turkey.[5][6][7] Outside of NATO, Switzerland and Singapore have placed orders for the aircraft, with other countries considering purchases. The program has drawn criticism for its unprecedented size, complexity, ballooning costs, and delayed deliveries.[8][N 1] The decision to start manufacturing the aircraft while it was still in development and testing led to expensive design changes and retrofits.[10][11] As of July 2024[update], the average unit costs (excluding the engine) are: US$82.5 million for the F-35A, $109 million for the F-35B, and $102.1 million for the F-35C.[12] The F135 engine costs $20.4 million as of August 2025.[13] The F-35 first flew in 2006; its variants entered U.S. service in July 2015 (Marine Corps F-35B), August 2016 (Air Force F-35A), and February 2019 (Navy F-35C).[2][3][4] The aircraft first saw combat in 2018, during Israeli Air Force attacks on Syria.[14] The F-35 has since been used in combat by the U.S. in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, and Venezuela; by Israel in Gaza, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen; and by the UK in Iraq and Syria. F-35As contribute to US nuclear forward deployment in European NATO countries. The U.S. plans to buy 2,456 F-35s through 2044, which will represent the bulk of its crewed fixed-wing tactical aviation for several decades; the aircraft is to be a cornerstone of NATO and U.S.-allied air power and operate until 2070.[15][16][17] The F-35 was the product of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, which was the merger of various combat aircraft programs from the 1980s and 1990s. One progenitor program was the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Short Take-Off/Vertical Landing (ASTOVL) which ran from 1983 to 1994; ASTOVL aimed to develop a Harrier jump jet replacement for the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) and the UK Royal Navy. Under one of ASTOVL's classified programs, the Supersonic STOVL Fighter (SSF), Lockheed's Skunk Works conducted research for a stealthy supersonic STOVL fighter intended for both U.S. Air Force (USAF) and USMC; among key STOVL technologies explored was the shaft-driven lift fan (SDLF) system. Lockheed's concept was a single-engine canard delta aircraft weighing about 24,000 lb (11,000 kg) empty. ASTOVL was rechristened as the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter (CALF) in 1993 and involved Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and Boeing.[18][19] The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused considerable reductions in Department of Defense (DoD) spending and subsequent restructuring. In 1993, the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program emerged following the cancellation of the USAF's Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) and U.S. Navy's (USN) Advanced Attack/Fighter (A/F-X) programs. MRF, a program for a relatively affordable F-16 Fighting Falcon replacement, was scaled back and delayed due to post–Cold War defense posture easing F-16 fleet usage and thus extending its service life as well as increasing budget pressure from the Lockheed Martin F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program. The A/F-X, initially known as the Advanced-Attack (A-X), began in 1991 as the USN's follow-on to the Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program for an Grumman A-6 Intruder replacement; the ATA's resulting McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II had been canceled due to technical problems and cost overruns in 1991. In the same year, the termination of the Naval Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), a naval development of USAF's ATF program to replace the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, resulted in additional fighter capability being added to A-X, which was then renamed A/F-X. Amid increased budget pressure, the DoD's Bottom-Up Review (BUR) in September 1993 announced MRF's and A/F-X's cancellations, with applicable experience brought to the emerging JAST program.[19] JAST was not meant to develop a new aircraft, but rather to develop requirements, mature technologies, and demonstrate concepts for advanced strike warfare.[20] As JAST progressed, the need for concept demonstrator aircraft by 1996 emerged, which would coincide with the full-scale flight demonstrator phase of ASTOVL/CALF. Because the ASTOVL/CALF concept appeared to align with the JAST charter, the two programs were eventually merged in 1994 under the JAST name, with the program now serving the USAF, USMC, and USN.[20] JAST was subsequently renamed to Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) in 1995, with STOVL submissions by McDonnell Douglas, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin,[N 2] and Boeing. The JSF was expected to eventually replace large numbers of multi-role and strike fighters in the inventories of the US and its allies, including the Harrier, F-16, F/A-18, Fairchild A-10 Thunderbolt II, and Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk.[21] International participation is a key aspect of the JSF program, starting with United Kingdom participation in the ASTOVL program. Many international partners requiring modernization of their air forces were interested in the JSF. The United Kingdom joined JAST/JSF as a founding member in 1995 and thus became the only Tier 1 partner of the JSF program;[22] Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Canada, Australia, and Turkey joined the program during the Concept Demonstration Phase (CDP), with Italy and the Netherlands being Tier 2 partners and the rest Tier 3. Consequently, the aircraft was developed in cooperation with international partners and available for export.[23] Boeing and Lockheed Martin were selected in early 1997 for CDP, with their concept demonstrator aircraft designated X-32 and X-35 respectively; the McDonnell Douglas team was eliminated and Northrop Grumman and British Aerospace joined the Lockheed Martin team. Each firm would produce two prototype air vehicles to demonstrate conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL), carrier takeoff and landing (CV), and STOVL.[N 3] Lockheed Martin's design would make use of the work on the SDLF system conducted under the ASTOVL/CALF program. The key aspect of the X-35 that enabled STOVL operation, the SDLF system consists of the lift fan in the forward center fuselage that could be activated by engaging a clutch that connects the driveshaft to the turbines and thus augmenting the thrust from the engine's swivel nozzle. Research from prior aircraft incorporating similar systems, such as the Convair Model 200,[N 4] Rockwell XFV-12, and Yakovlev Yak-141, were also taken into consideration.[25][26][27] By contrast, Boeing's X-32 employed a direct lift system that the augmented turbofan would be reconfigured to when engaging in STOVL operation. Lockheed Martin's commonality strategy was to replace the STOVL variant's SDLF with a fuel tank and the aft swivel nozzle with a two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzle for the CTOL variant.[N 5] STOVL operation is made possible through a patented shaft-driven LiftFan propulsion system.[28] This would enable identical aerodynamic configuration for the STOVL and CTOL variants, while the CV variant would have an enlarged wing to reduce landing speed for carrier recovery. Due to aerodynamic characteristics and carrier recovery requirements from the JAST merger, the design configuration settled on a conventional tail compared to the canard delta design from the ASTOVL/CALF; notably, the conventional tail configuration offers much lower risk for carrier recovery compared to the ASTOVL/CALF canard configuration, which was designed without carrier compatibility in mind. This enabled greater commonality between all three variants, as the commonality goal was important at this design stage.[29] Lockheed Martin's prototypes would consist of the X-35A for demonstrating CTOL before converting it to the X-35B for STOVL demonstration and the larger-winged X-35C for CV compatibility demonstration.[30] The X-35A first flew on 24 October 2000 and conducted flight tests for subsonic and supersonic flying qualities, handling, range, and maneuver performance.[31] After 28 flights, the aircraft was then converted into the X-35B for STOVL testing, with key changes including the addition of the SDLF, the three-bearing swivel module (3BSM), and roll-control ducts. The X-35B would successfully demonstrate the SDLF system by performing stable hover, vertical landing, and short takeoff in less than 500 ft (150 m).[29][32] The X-35C first flew on 16 December 2000 and conducted field landing carrier practice tests.[31] On 26 October 2001, Lockheed Martin was declared the winner and was awarded the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract; Pratt & Whitney was separately awarded a development contract for the F135 engine for the JSF.[33] The F-35 designation, which was out of sequence with standard DoD numbering, was allegedly determined on the spot by program manager Major General Mike Hough; this came as a surprise even to Lockheed Martin, which had expected the F-24 designation for the JSF.[34] As the JSF program moved into the System Development and Demonstration phase, the X-35 demonstrator design was modified to create the F-35 combat aircraft. The forward fuselage was lengthened by 5 inches (13 cm) to make room for mission avionics, while the horizontal stabilizers were moved 2 inches (5.1 cm) aft to retain balance and control. The diverterless supersonic inlet changed from a four-sided to a three-sided cowl shape and was moved 30 inches (76 cm) aft. The fuselage section was fuller, the top surface raised by 1 inch (2.5 cm) along the centerline and the lower surface bulged to accommodate weapons bays. Following the designation of the X-35 prototypes, the three variants were designated F-35A (CTOL), F-35B (STOVL), and F-35C (CV), all with a design service life of 8,000 hours. Prime contractor Lockheed Martin performs overall systems integration and final assembly and checkout (FACO) at Air Force Plant 4 in Fort Worth, Texas,[N 6] while Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems supply components for mission systems and airframe.[35][36] Adding the systems of a fighter aircraft added weight. The F-35B gained the most, largely due to a 2003 decision to enlarge the weapons bays for commonality between variants; the total weight growth was reportedly up to 2,200 pounds (1,000 kg), over 8%, causing all STOVL key performance parameter (KPP) thresholds to be missed.[37] In December 2003, the STOVL Weight Attack Team (SWAT) was formed to reduce the weight increase; changes included thinned airframe members, smaller weapons bays and vertical stabilizers, less thrust fed to the roll-post outlets, and redesigning the wing-mate joint, electrical elements, and the airframe immediately aft of the cockpit. The inlet was also revised to accommodate more powerful, greater mass flow engines.[38][39] Many changes from the SWAT effort were applied to all three variants for commonality. By September 2004, these efforts had reduced the F-35B's weight by over 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg), while the F-35A and F-35C were reduced in weight by 2,400 pounds (1,100 kg) and 1,900 pounds (860 kg) respectively.[29][40] The weight reduction work cost $6.2 billion and caused an 18-month delay.[41] The first F-35A, designated AA-1, was rolled out at Fort Worth on 19 February 2006 and first flew on 15 December 2006 with chief test pilot Jon S. Beesley at the controls.[N 7][42] In 2006, the F-35 was given the name \"Lightning II\" after the Lockheed P-38 Lightning of World War II.[43] Some USAF pilots have nicknamed the aircraft \"Panther\" instead, and other nicknames include \"Fat Amy\" and \"Battle Penguin\".[44][45][46] The aircraft's software was developed as six releases, or Blocks, for SDD. The first two Blocks, 1A and 1B, readied the F-35 for initial pilot training and multi-level security. Block 2A improved the training capabilities, while 2B was the first combat-ready release planned for the USMC's Initial Operating Capability (IOC). Block 3i retains the capabilities of 2B while having new Technology Refresh 2 (TR-2) hardware and was planned for the USAF's IOC. The final release for SDD, Block 3F, would have full flight envelope and all baseline combat capabilities. Alongside software releases, each block also incorporates avionics hardware updates and air vehicle improvements from flight and structural testing.[47] In what is known as \"concurrency\", some low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft lots would be delivered in early Block configurations and eventually upgraded to Block 3F once development is complete.[48] After 17,000 flight test hours, the final flight for the SDD phase was completed in April 2018.[49] Like the F-22, the F-35 has been targeted by cyberattacks and technology theft efforts, as well as potential vulnerabilities in the integrity of the supply chain.[50][51][52] Testing found several major problems: early F-35B airframes were vulnerable to premature cracking,[N 8] the F-35C arrestor hook design was unreliable, fuel tanks were too vulnerable to lightning strikes, the helmet display had problems, and more. Software was repeatedly delayed due to its unprecedented scope and complexity. In 2009, the DoD Joint Estimate Team (JET) estimated that the program was 30 months behind the public schedule.[53][54] In 2011, the program was \"re-baselined\"; that is, its cost and schedule goals were changed, pushing the IOC from the planned 2010 to July 2015.[55][56] The decision to simultaneously test, fix defects, and begin production was criticized as inefficient; in 2014, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Frank Kendall called it \"acquisition malpractice\".[57] The three variants shared just 25% of their parts, far below the anticipated commonality of 70%.[58] The program received considerable criticism for cost overruns and for the total projected lifetime cost, as well as quality management shortcomings by contractors.[59][60] As of August 2023[update], the program was 80% over budget and 10 years late.[61] The JSF program was expected to cost about $200 billion for acquisition in base-year 2002 dollars when SDD was awarded in 2001.[62][63] As early as 2005, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) had identified major program risks in cost and schedule.[64] The costly delays strained the relationship between the Pentagon and contractors.[65] By 2017, delays and cost overruns had pushed the F-35 program's expected acquisition costs to $406.5 billion, with total lifetime cost (i.e., to 2070) to $1.5 trillion in then-year dollars which also includes operations and maintenance.[66][67][68] The F-35A's unit cost (not including engine) for LRIP Lot 13 was $79.2 million in base-year 2012 dollars.[69] Delays in development and operational test and evaluation, including integration into the Joint Simulation Environment, pushed full-rate production decision from the end of 2019 to March 2024, although actual production rate had already approached the full rate by 2020; the combined full rate at the Fort Worth, Italy, and Japan FACO plants is 156 aircraft annually.[70][71] The F-35 is expected to be continually upgraded over its lifetime. The first combat-capable Block 2B configuration, which had basic air-to-air and strike capabilities, was declared ready by the USMC in July 2015.[2] The Block 3F configuration began operational test and evaluation (OT&E) in December 2018 and its completion in late 2023 concluded SDD in March 2024.[72] The F-35 program is also conducting sustainment and upgrade development, with early aircraft from LRIP lot 2 onwards gradually upgraded to the baseline Block 3F standard by 2021.[73][needs update] With Block 3F as the final build for SDD, the first major upgrade program is Block 4 which began development in 2019 and was initially captured under the Continuous Capability Development and Delivery (C2D2) program. Block 4 is expected to enter service in incremental steps from the late 2020s to early 2030s and integrates additional weapons, including those unique to international customers, improved sensor capabilities including the new AN/APG-85 AESA radar and additional ESM bandwidth, and adds Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) support.[74][75] C2D2 also places greater emphasis on agile software development to enable quicker releases.[76] The key enabler of Block 4 is Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) avionics hardware, which consists of new display, core processor, and memory modules to support increased processing requirements, as well as engine upgrade that increases the amount of cooling available to support the additional mission systems. The engine upgrade effort explored both improvements to the F135 as well as significantly more power and efficient adaptive cycle engines. In 2018, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney were awarded contracts to develop adaptive cycle engines for potential application in the F-35,[N 9] and in 2022, the F-35 Adaptive Engine Replacement program was launched to integrate them.[77][78] However, in 2023 the USAF chose an improved F135 under the Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) program over an adaptive cycle engine due to cost as well as concerns over risk of integrating the new engine, initially designed for the F-35A, on the B and C.[79] Difficulties with the new TR-3 hardware, including regression testing, have caused delays to Block 4 as well as a halt in aircraft deliveries from July 2023 to July 2024.[80][81] In 2023, the GAO raised concerns in two reports that the estimated cost of the Block 4 upgrade has increased from $10.6 billion to $16.5 billion and completion of the upgrade is delayed from 2026 to 2029 the earliest.[82] In September 2025, it was announced that the Block 4 upgrade would be truncated and delayed due to technological uncertainties and engine upgrade delays, among other reasons. Critical changes that do not require an upgraded engine will remain in Block 4 and be ready by 2031 at the earliest. Upgrades that where originally planned for Block 4, but require the upgraded engine, or lack technological maturity, will be deferred to currently undefined efforts expected in the mid 2030s. Block 4 was originally intended to be completed in 2026.[83][84] Defense contractors have offered upgrades to the F-35 outside of official program contracts. In 2013, Northrop Grumman disclosed its development of a directional infrared countermeasures suite, named Threat Nullification Defensive Resource (ThNDR). The countermeasure system would share the same space as the Distributed Aperture System (DAS) sensors and acts as a laser missile jammer to protect against infrared-homing missiles.[85] Israel operates a unique subvariant of the F-35A, designated the F-35I, that is designed to better interface with and incorporate Israeli equipment and weapons. The Israeli Air Force also has their own F-35I test aircraft that provides more access to the core avionics to include their own equipment.[86] The United States is the primary customer and financial backer, with planned procurement of 1,763 F-35As for the USAF, 353 F-35Bs and 67 F-35Cs for the USMC, and 273 F-35Cs for the USN.[15] Additionally, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Australia, Norway, Denmark and Canada have agreed to contribute US$4.375 billion towards development costs, with the United Kingdom contributing about 10% of the planned development costs as the sole Tier 1 partner.[22] Britain supplies ejector seats, rear fuselage, active interceptor systems, targeting lasers and weapon release cables, mainly through British Aerospace, amounting to 15% of the value of the F-35, and is the largest supplier of spare parts for the jet after the US.[87] The initial plan was that the U.S. and eight major partner countries would acquire over 3,100 F-35s through 2035.[88] The three tiers of international participation generally reflect financial stake in the program, the amount of technology transfer and subcontracts open for bid by national companies, and the order in which countries can obtain production aircraft.[89] Alongside program partner countries, Israel and Singapore have joined as Security Cooperative Participants (SCP).[90][91][92] Sales to SCP and non-partner states, including Belgium, Japan, and South Korea, are made through the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales program.[7][93] Turkey was removed from the F-35 program in July 2019 over security concerns following its purchase of a Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system.[94][95][N 10] As of July 2024[update], the average flyaway costs per plane are: $82.5 million for the F-35A, $109 million for the F-35B, and $102.1 million for the F-35C.[12] The cost of the F-35 does not include the cost of the engine as this is negotiated in a separate contract, and engines are delivered free of charge to Lockheed Martin. The cost of the engine is $20.4 million in lot 18.[97] Lockheed Martin delivered a record 191 F-35 Lightning II fighter jets in 2025, bringing the global fleet to approximately 1,300 aircraft.[98] The F-35 is a family of single-engine, supersonic, stealth multirole strike fighters.[99] The second fifth-generation fighter to enter US service and the first operational supersonic STOVL stealth fighter, the F-35 emphasizes low observables, advanced avionics and sensor fusion that enable a high level of situational awareness and long range lethality;[100][101][102] the USAF considers the aircraft its primary strike fighter for conducting suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) and air interdiction missions, owing to the advanced sensors and mission systems.[103] The F-35 has a wing-tail configuration with two vertical stabilizers canted for stealth. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons,[N 11] rudders, and all-moving horizontal tails (stabilators); leading edge root extensions or chines[104] also run forwards to the inlets. The relatively short 35-foot wingspan of the F-35A and F-35B is set by the requirement to fit inside USN amphibious assault ship parking areas and elevators; the F-35C's larger wing is more fuel efficient.[105][106] The fixed diverterless supersonic inlets (DSI) use a bumped compression surface and forward-swept cowl to shed the boundary layer of the forebody away from the inlets, which form a Y-duct for the engine.[107] Structurally, the F-35 drew upon lessons from the F-22; composites comprise 35% of airframe weight, with the majority being bismaleimide and composite epoxy materials as well as some carbon nanotube-reinforced epoxy in later production lots.[108][109][110] The F-35 is considerably heavier than the lightweight fighters it replaces, with the lightest variant having an empty weight of 29,300 lb (13,300 kg); much of the weight can be attributed to the internal weapons bays and the extensive avionics carried.[111] Each F-35 contains about 50 pounds (23 kg) of samarium magnets.[112] While lacking the kinematic performance of the larger twin-engine F-22, the F-35 is competitive with fourth-generation fighters such as the F-16 and F/A-18, especially when they carry weapons because the F-35's internal weapons bay eliminates drag from external stores.[113] All variants have a top speed of Mach 1.6 (1,220 mph; 1,960 km/h), attainable with full internal payload. The Pratt & Whitney F135 engine gives good subsonic acceleration and energy, with supersonic dash in afterburner. The F-35, while not a \"supercruising\" aircraft, can fly at Mach 1.2 (913 mph; 1,470 km/h) for a dash of 150 miles (240 km) with afterburners. This ability can be useful in battlefield situations.[114] The large stabilitors, leading edge extensions and flaps, and canted rudders provide excellent high alpha (angle-of-attack) characteristics, with a trimmed alpha of 50°. Relaxed stability and triplex-redundant fly-by-wire controls provide excellent handling qualities and departure resistance.[115][116] Having over double the F-16's internal fuel, the F-35 has a considerably greater combat radius, while stealth also enables a more efficient mission flight profile.[117] The F-35's mission systems are among the most complex aspects of the aircraft. The avionics and sensor fusion are designed to improve the pilot's situational awareness and command-and-control capabilities and facilitate network-centric warfare.[99][118] Key sensors include the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, BAE Systems AN/ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare system, Northrop Grumman/Raytheon AN/AAQ-37 Electro-optical Distributed Aperture System (DAS), Lockheed Martin AN/AAQ-40 Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) and Northrop Grumman AN/ASQ-242 Communications, Navigation, and Identification (CNI) suite. The F-35 was designed for its sensors to work together to provide a cohesive image of the local battlespace; for example, the APG-81 radar also acts as a part of the electronic warfare system.[119] Much of the F-35's software was developed in C and C++ programming languages, while Ada83 code from the F-22 was also used; the Block 3F software has 8.6 million lines of code.[120][121] The Green Hills Software Integrity DO-178B real-time operating system (RTOS) runs on integrated core processors (ICPs); data networking includes the IEEE 1394b and Fibre Channel buses.[122][123] The avionics use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components when practical to make upgrades cheaper and more flexible; for example, to enable fleet software upgrades for the software-defined radio (SDR) systems.[124][125][126] The mission systems software, particularly for sensor fusion, was one of the program's most difficult parts and responsible for substantial program delays.[N 12][128][129] The APG-81 radar uses electronic scanning for rapid beam agility and incorporates passive and active air-to-air modes, strike modes, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) capability, with multiple target track-while-scan at ranges in excess of 80 nmi (150 km). The antenna is tilted backwards for stealth.[130] Complementing the radar is the AAQ-37 DAS: six infrared sensors that can track targets and warn of approaching missiles all around the aircraft; it acts as a situational-awareness infrared search and track (SAIRST) and feeds spherical infrared and night-vision imagery to the helmet visor.[131] The ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare system has ten radio frequency antennas embedded into the edges of the wing and tail for all-aspect radar warning receiver (RWR). It also provides sensor fusion of radio frequency and infrared tracking functions, geolocation threat targeting, and multispectral image countermeasures for self-defense against missiles. The electronic warfare system can detect and jam hostile radars.[132] The AAQ-40 EOTS is mounted behind a faceted low-observable window under the nose and performs laser targeting, forward-looking infrared (FLIR), and long range IRST functions.[133] The ASQ-242 CNI suite uses a half dozen physical links, including the directional Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL), for covert CNI functions.[134][135] Information from radio frequency receivers and infrared sensors are combined to form a single tactical picture for the pilot. The all-aspect target direction and identification can be shared via MADL to other platforms without compromising low observability, while Link 16 enables communication with older systems.[136] The F-35 was designed to accept upgrades to its processors, sensors, and software. Technology Refresh 3, which includes a new core processor and a new cockpit display, is planned for Lot 15 aircraft.[137] Lockheed Martin has offered the Advanced EOTS for the Block 4 configuration; the improved sensor fits into the same area as the baseline EOTS with minimal changes.[138] In June 2018, Lockheed Martin picked Raytheon for improved DAS.[139] The USAF has studied the potential for the F-35 to orchestrate attacks by unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) via its sensors and communications equipment.[140] A new radar called the AN/APG-85 is planned for Block 4 F-35s.[141] According to the JPO, the new radar will be compatible with all three major F-35 variants. However, it is unclear if older aircraft will be retrofitted with the new radar.[141] Stealth is a key aspect of the F-35's design, and radar cross-section (RCS) is minimized through careful shaping of the airframe and the use of radar-absorbent materials (RAM); visible measures to reduce RCS include alignment of edges and continuous curvature of surfaces, serration of skin panels, and the masking of the engine face and turbine. Additionally, the F-35's diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) uses a compression bump and forward-swept cowl rather than a splitter gap or bleed system to divert the boundary layer away from the inlet duct, eliminating the diverter cavity and further reducing radar signature.[107][142] The RCS of the F-35 has been characterized as lower than a metal golf ball at certain frequencies and angles; in some conditions, the F-35 compares favorably to the F-22 in stealth.[143][144][145] For maintainability, the F-35's stealth design took lessons from earlier stealth aircraft such as the F-22; the F-35's radar-absorbent fibermat skin is more durable and requires less maintenance than older topcoats.[146] The aircraft also has reduced infrared and visual signatures as well as strict controls of radio frequency emitters to prevent their detection.[147][148][149] The F-35's stealth design is primarily focused on high-frequency X-band wavelengths;[150] low-frequency radars can spot stealthy aircraft due to Rayleigh scattering, but such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and lack precision.[151][152][153] To disguise its RCS, the aircraft can mount four Luneburg lens reflectors.[154] Overseas deployments of the F-35, including the Estonia, Bulgaria, and South Korea, use these radar reflectors to prevent Russian and Chinese intelligence gathering on the true RCS signature. There were concerns that Russian involvement in the Syrian civil war allowed the country to gather true RCS data on Israeli F-35Is flying without reflectors over Lebanon, as well as US F-22s.[155] Noise from the F-35 caused concerns in residential areas near potential bases for the aircraft, and residents near two such bases—Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, and Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), Florida—requested environmental impact studies in 2008 and 2009 respectively.[156] Although the noise levels, in decibels, were comparable to those of prior fighters such as the F-16, the F-35's sound power is stronger—particularly at lower frequencies.[157] Subsequent surveys and studies have indicated that the noise of the F-35 was not perceptibly different from the F-16 and F/A-18E/F, though the greater low-frequency noise was noticeable for some observers.[158][159][160] The glass cockpit was designed to give the pilot good situational awareness. The main display is a 20-by-8-inch (50 by 20 cm) panoramic touchscreen, which shows flight instruments, stores management, CNI information, and integrated caution and warnings; the pilot can customize the arrangement of the information. Below the main display is a smaller stand-by display.[161] The cockpit has a speech-recognition system developed by Adacel.[162] The F-35 does not have a head-up display; instead, flight and combat information is displayed on the visor of the pilot's helmet in a helmet-mounted display system (HMDS).[163] The one-piece tinted canopy is hinged at the front and has an internal frame for structural strength. The Martin-Baker US16E ejection seat is launched by a twin-catapult system housed on side rails.[164] There is a right-hand side stick and throttle hands-on throttle-and-stick system. For life support, an onboard oxygen-generation system (OBOGS) is fitted and powered by the Integrated Power Package (IPP), with an auxiliary oxygen bottle and backup oxygen system for emergencies.[165] The Vision Systems International[N 13] helmet display is a key piece of the F-35's human-machine interface. Instead of the head-up display mounted atop the dashboard of earlier fighters, the HMDS puts flight and combat information on the helmet visor, allowing the pilot to see it no matter which way they are facing.[166] Infrared and night vision imagery from the Distributed Aperture System can be displayed directly on the HMDS and enables the pilot to \"see through\" the aircraft. The HMDS allows an F-35 pilot to fire missiles at targets even when the nose of the aircraft is pointing elsewhere by cuing missile seekers at high angles off-boresight.[167][168] Each helmet costs $400,000.[169] The HMDS weighs more than traditional helmets, and there is concern that it can endanger lightweight pilots during ejection.[170] Due to the HMDS's vibration, jitter, night-vision and sensor display problems during development, Lockheed Martin and Elbit issued a draft specification in 2011 for an alternative HMDS based on the AN/AVS-9 night vision goggles as backup, with BAE Systems chosen later that year.[171][172] A cockpit redesign would be needed to adopt an alternative HMDS.[173][174] Following progress on the baseline helmet, development on the alternative HMDS was halted in October 2013.[175][176] In 2016, the Gen 3 helmet with improved night vision camera, new liquid crystal displays, automated alignment and software enhancements was introduced with LRIP lot 7.[175] To preserve its stealth shaping, the F-35 has two internal weapons bays each with two weapons stations. The two outboard weapon stations each can carry ordnance up to 2,500 lb (1,100 kg), or 1,500 lb (680 kg) for the F-35B, while the two inboard stations carry air-to-air missiles. Air-to-surface weapons for the outboard station include the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Paveway series of bombs, Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), and cluster munitions (Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser). The station can also carry multiple smaller munitions such as the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), GBU-53/B StormBreaker and SPEAR 3; up to four SDBs can be carried per station for the F-35A and F-35C, and three for the F-35B.[177][178][179] The F-35A achieved certification to carry the B61 Mod 12 nuclear bomb in October 2023.[180] The inboard station can carry the AIM-120 AMRAAM and eventually the AIM-260 JATM. Two compartments behind the weapons bays contain flares, chaff, and towed decoys.[181] The aircraft can use six external weapons stations for missions that do not require stealth.[182] The wingtip pylons each can carry an AIM-9X or AIM-132 ASRAAM and are canted outwards to reduce their radar cross-section.[183][184] Additionally, each wing has a 5,000 lb (2,300 kg) inboard station and a 2,500 lb (1,100 kg) middle station, or 1,500 lb (680 kg) for F-35B. The external wing stations can carry large air-to-surface weapons that would not fit inside the weapons bays such as the AGM-158 Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) or AGM-158C LRASM cruise missile. An air-to-air missile load of eight AIM-120s and two AIM-9s is possible using internal and external weapons stations; a configuration of six 2,000 lb (910 kg) bombs, two AIM-120s and two AIM-9s can also be arranged.[167][185][186] The F-35 is armed with a 25 mm GAU-22/A rotary cannon, a lighter four-barrel variant of the GAU-12/U Equalizer.[187] On the F-35A this is mounted internally near the left wing root with 182 rounds carried;[citation needed] the gun is more effective against ground targets than the 20 mm gun carried by other USAF fighters.[dubious – discuss][citation needed] In 2020, a USAF report noted \"unacceptable\" accuracy problems with the GAU-22/A on the F-35A. These were due to \"misalignments\" in the gun's mount, which was also susceptible to cracking.[188] These problems were resolved by 2024.[189] The F-35B and F-35C have no internal gun and instead can use a Terma A/S multi-mission pod (MMP) carrying the GAU-22/A and 220 rounds; the pod is mounted on the centerline of the aircraft and shaped to reduce its radar cross-section.[187][190][verification needed] In lieu of the gun, the pod can also be used for different equipment and purposes, such as electronic warfare, aerial reconnaissance, or rear-facing tactical radar.[191][192] The pod was not susceptible to the accuracy issues that once plagued the gun on the F-35A variant,[188] though was apparently not problem-free.[189] Lockheed Martin is developing a weapon rack called Sidekick that would enable the internal outboard station to carry two AIM-120s, thus increasing the internal air-to-air payload to six missiles, currently offered for Block 4.[193][194] Block 4 will also have a rearranged hydraulic line and bracket to allow the F-35B to carry four SDBs per internal outboard station; integration of the MBDA Meteor is also planned.[195][196] The USAF and USN are planning to integrate the AGM-88G AARGM-ER internally in the F-35A and F-35C.[197] Norway and Australia are funding an adaptation of the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) for the F-35; designated Joint Strike Missile (JSM), two missiles can be carried internally with an additional four externally.[198] Both hypersonic missiles and direct energy weapons such as solid-state laser are currently being considered as future upgrades; in 2024, Lockheed Martin disclosed its proposed Mako hypersonic missile, which can be carried internally in the F-35A and C and externally on the B.[199][N 14][203] Additionally, Lockheed Martin is studying integrating a fiber laser that uses spectral beam combining multiple individual laser modules into a single high-power beam, which can be scaled to various levels.[204] The USAF plans for the F-35A to take up the close air support (CAS) mission in contested environments; amid criticism that it is not as well suited as a dedicated attack platform, USAF chief of staff Mark Welsh placed a focus on weapons for CAS sorties, including guided rockets, fragmentation rockets that shatter into individual projectiles before impact, and more compact ammunition for higher capacity gun pods.[205] Fragmentary rocket warheads create greater effects than cannon shells as each rocket creates a \"thousand-round burst\", delivering more projectiles than a strafing run.[206] The aircraft is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney F135 low-bypass augmented turbofan with rated thrust of 28,000 lbf (125 kN) at military power and 43,000 lbf (191 kN) with afterburner. Derived from the Pratt & Whitney F119 used by the F-22, the F135 has a larger fan and higher bypass ratio to increase subsonic thrust and fuel efficiency, and unlike the F119, is not optimized for supercruise.[207] The engine contributes to the F-35's stealth by having a low-observable augmenter, or afterburner, that incorporates fuel injectors into thick curved vanes; these vanes are covered by ceramic radar-absorbent materials and mask the turbine. The stealthy augmenter had problems with pressure pulsations, or \"screech\", at low altitude and high speed early in its development.[208] The low-observable axisymmetric nozzle consists of 15 partially overlapping flaps that create a sawtooth pattern at the trailing edge, which reduces radar signature and creates shed vortices that reduce the infrared signature of the exhaust plume.[209] Due to the engine's large dimensions, the U.S. Navy had to modify its underway replenishment system to facilitate at-sea logistics support.[210] The F-35's Integrated Power Package (IPP) performs power and thermal management and integrates environment control, auxiliary power unit, engine starting, and other functions into a single system.[211] The F135-PW-600 variant for the F-35B incorporates the Shaft-Driven Lift Fan (SDLF) to allow STOVL operations. Designed by Lockheed Martin and developed by Rolls-Royce, the SDLF, also known as the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem, consists of the lift fan, drive shaft, two roll posts, and a \"three-bearing swivel module\" (3BSM). The nozzle features three bearings resembling a short cylinder with nonparallel bases. As the toothed edges are rotated by motors, the nozzle swivels from being linear with the engine to being perpendicular. The thrust vectoring 3BSM nozzle allows the main engine exhaust to be deflected downward at the tail of the aircraft and is moved by a \"fueldraulic\" actuator that uses pressurized fuel as the working fluid.[212][213][214] Unlike the Harrier's Pegasus engine that entirely uses direct engine thrust for lift, the F-35B's system augments the swivel nozzle's thrust with the lift fan; the fan is powered by the low-pressure turbine through a drive shaft when engaged with a clutch and placed near the front of the aircraft to provide a torque countering that of the 3BSM nozzle.[215][216][217] Roll control during slow flight is achieved by diverting unheated engine bypass air through wing-mounted thrust nozzles called roll posts.[218][219] An alternative engine, the General Electric/Allison/Rolls-Royce F136, was being developed in the 1990s and 2000s; originally, F-35 engines from Lot 6 onward were competitively tendered. Using technology from the General Electric YF120, the F136 was claimed to have a greater temperature margin than the F135 due to the higher mass flow design making full use of the inlet.[38][220] The F136 was canceled in December 2011 due to lack of funding.[221][222] The F-35 is expected to receive propulsion upgrades over its lifecycle to adapt to emerging threats and enable additional capabilities. In 2016, the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP) was launched to develop and test adaptive cycle engines, with one major potential application being the re-engining of the F-35; in 2018, both GE and P&W were awarded contracts to develop 45,000 lbf (200 kN) thrust class demonstrators, with the designations XA100 and XA101 respectively.[77] In addition to potential re-engining, P&W is also developing improvements to the baseline F135; the Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) is an update to the power module, originally called Growth Option 1.0 and then Engine Enhancement Package, that improves engine thrust and fuel burn by 5% and bleed air cooling capacity by 50% to support Block 4.[223][224][225] The F135 ECU was selected over AETP engines in 2023 to provide additional power and cooling for the F-35. Although GE had expected that the more revolutionary XA100 could enter service with the F-35A and C by 2027 and could be adapted for the F-35B, the increased cost and risk caused the USAF to choose the F135 ECU instead.[226][79] The F-35 is designed to require less maintenance than prior stealth aircraft. Some 95% of all field-replaceable parts are \"one deep\"—that is, nothing else needs to be removed to reach the desired part; for instance, the ejection seat can be replaced without removing the canopy. The F-35 has a fibermat radar-absorbent material (RAM) baked into the skin, which is more durable, easier to work with, and faster to cure than older RAM coatings; similar coatings are being considered for application on older stealth aircraft such as the F-22.[146][227][228] Skin corrosion on the F-22 led to the F-35 using a less galvanic corrosion-inducing skin gap filler, fewer gaps in the airframe skin needing filler, and better drainage.[229] The flight control system uses electro-hydrostatic actuators rather than traditional hydraulic systems; these controls can be powered by lithium-ion batteries in case of emergency.[230][231][232] Commonality between variants led to the USMC's first aircraft maintenance Field Training Detachment, which applied USAF lessons to their F-35 operations.[233] The F-35 was initially supported by a computerized maintenance management system named Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS). In concept, any F-35 can be serviced at any maintenance facility and all parts can be globally tracked and shared as needed.[234] Due to numerous problems,[235] such as unreliable diagnoses, excessive connectivity requirements, and security vulnerabilities, ALIS is being replaced by the cloud-based Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN).[236][237][238] From September 2020, ODIN base kits (OBKs)[239] were running ALIS software, as well as ODIN software, first at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, Arizona, then at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California, in support of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 125 on 16 July 2021, and then Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, in support of the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) on 6 August 2021. In 2022, over a dozen more OBK sites will replace the ALIS's Standard Operating Unit unclassified (SOU-U) servers.[240] OBK performance is double that of ALIS.[241][240][239] The first F-35A, AA-1, conducted its engine run in September 2006 and first flew on 15 December 2006.[242] Unlike all subsequent aircraft, AA-1 did not have the weight optimization from SWAT; consequently, it mainly tested subsystems common to subsequent aircraft, such as the propulsion, electrical system, and cockpit displays. This aircraft was retired from flight testing in December 2009 and was used for live-fire testing at NAS China Lake.[243] The first F-35B, BF-1, flew on 11 June 2008, while the first weight-optimized F-35A and F-35C, AF-1 and CF-1, flew on 14 November 2009 and 6 June 2010 respectively. The F-35B's first hover was on 17 March 2010, followed by its first vertical landing the next day.[244] The F-35 Integrated Test Force (ITF) consisted of 18 aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Patuxent River. Nine aircraft at Edwards, five F-35As, three F-35Bs, and one F-35C, performed flight sciences testing such as F-35A envelope expansion, flight loads, stores separation, as well as mission systems testing. The other nine aircraft at Patuxent River, five F-35Bs and four F-35Cs, were responsible for F-35B and C envelope expansion and STOVL and CV suitability testing. Additional carrier suitability testing was conducted at Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Two non-flying aircraft of each variant were used to test static loads and fatigue.[245] For testing avionics and mission systems, a modified Boeing 737-300 with a duplication of the cockpit, the Lockheed Martin CATBird has been used.[194] Field testing of the F-35's sensors were conducted during Exercise Northern Edge 2009 and 2011, serving as significant risk-reduction steps.[246][247] Flight tests revealed several serious deficiencies that required costly redesigns, caused delays, and resulted in several fleet-wide groundings. In 2011, the F-35C failed to catch the arresting wire in all eight landing tests; a redesigned tail hook was delivered two years later.[248][249] By June 2009, many of the initial flight test targets had been accomplished but the program was behind schedule.[250] Software and mission systems were among the biggest sources of delays for the program, with sensor fusion proving especially challenging.[129] In fatigue testing, the F-35B suffered several premature cracks, requiring a redesign of the structure.[251] A third non-flying F-35B is currently planned to test the redesigned structure. The F-35B and C also had problems with the horizontal tails suffering heat damage from prolonged afterburner use.[N 15][254][255] Early flight control laws had problems with \"wing drop\"[N 16] and also made the airplane sluggish, with high angles-of-attack tests in 2015 against an F-16 showing a lack of energy.[256][257] At-sea testing of the F-35B was first conducted aboard USS Wasp. In October 2011, two F-35Bs conducted three weeks of initial sea trials, called Development Test I.[258] The second F-35B sea trials, Development Test II, began in August 2013, with tests including nighttime operations; two aircraft completed 19 nighttime vertical landings using DAS imagery.[259][260] The first operational testing involving six F-35Bs was done on the Wasp in May 2015. The final Development Test III on USS America involving operations in high sea states was completed in late 2016.[261] A Royal Navy F-35 conducted the first \"rolling\" landing on board HMS Queen Elizabeth in October 2018.[262] After the redesigned tail hook arrived, the F-35C's carrier-based Development Test I began in November 2014 aboard USS Nimitz and focused on basic day carrier operations and establishing launch and recovery handling procedures.[263] Development Test II, which focused on night operations, weapons loading, and full power launches, took place in October 2015. The final Development Test III was completed in August 2016, and included tests of asymmetric loads and certifying systems for landing qualifications and interoperability.[264] Operational test of the F-35C was conducted in 2018 and the first operational squadron achieved safe-for-flight milestone that December, paving the way for its introduction in 2019.[4][265] The F-35's reliability and availability have fallen short of requirements, especially in the early years of testing. The ALIS maintenance and logistics system was plagued by excessive connectivity requirements and faulty diagnoses. In late 2017, the GAO reported the time needed to repair an F-35 part averaged 172 days, which was \"twice the program's objective\", and that shortage of spare parts was degrading readiness.[266] In 2019, while individual F-35 units have achieved mission-capable rates of over the target of 80% for short periods during deployed operations, fleet-wide rates remained below target. The fleet availability goal of 65% was also not met, although the trend shows improvement. Internal gun accuracy of the F-35A was unacceptable until misalignment issues were addressed by 2024.[254][267] As of 2020, the number of the program's most serious issues have been decreased by half.[268][189] Operational test and evaluation (OT&E) with Block 3F, the final configuration for SDD, began in December 2018, but its completion was delayed particularly by technical problems in integration with the DOD's Joint Simulation Environment (JSE);[269] the F-35 finally completed all JSE trials in September 2023.[71] The F-35A and F-35B were cleared for basic flight training in early 2012, although there were concerns over safety and performance due to lack of system maturity at the time.[270][271][272] During the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase, the three U.S. military services jointly developed tactics and procedures using flight simulators, testing effectiveness, discovering problems and refining design. On 10 September 2012, the USAF began an operational utility evaluation (OUE) of the F-35A, including logistical support, maintenance, personnel training, and pilot execution.[273][274] The USMC F-35B Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) was initially based at Eglin AFB in 2012 alongside USAF F-35A training units, before moving to MCAS Beaufort in 2014 while another FRS was stood up at MCAS Miramar in 2020.[275][276] The USAF F-35A basic course is held at Eglin AFB and Luke AFB; in January 2013, training began at Eglin with capacity for 100 pilots and 2,100 maintainers at once.[277] Additionally, the 6th Weapons Squadron of the USAF Weapons School was activated at Nellis AFB in June 2017 for F-35A weapons instructor curriculum while the 65th Aggressor Squadron was reactivated with the F-35A in June 2022 to expand training against adversary stealth aircraft tactics.[278] The USN stood up its F-35C FRS in 2012 with VFA-101 at Eglin AFB, but operations would later be transferred and consolidated under VFA-125 at NAS Lemoore in 2019.[279] The F-35C was introduced to the Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor course, or TOPGUN, in 2020 and the additional capabilities of the aircraft greatly revamped the course syllabus.[280] On 16 November 2012, the USMC received the first F-35B of VMFA-121 at MCAS Yuma.[281] The USMC declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the F-35B in the Block 2B configuration on 31 July 2015 after operational trials, with some limitations in night operations, mission systems, and weapons carriage.[2][282] USMC F-35Bs participated in their first Red Flag exercise in July 2016 with 67 sorties conducted.[283] The first F-35B deployment occurred in 2017 at MCAS Iwakuni, Japan; combat employment began in July 2018 from the amphibious assault ship USS Essex, with the first combat strike on 27 September 2018 against a Taliban target in Afghanistan.[284] In addition to deploying F-35Bs on amphibious assault ships, the USMC plans to disperse the aircraft among austere forward-deployed bases with shelter and concealment to enhance survivability while remaining close to a battlespace. Known as distributed STOVL operations (DSO), F-35Bs would operate from temporary bases in allied territory within hostile missile engagement zones and displace inside the enemy's 24- to 48-hour targeting cycle; this strategy allows F-35Bs to rapidly respond to operational needs, with mobile forward arming and refueling points (M-FARPs) accommodating KC-130 and MV-22 Osprey aircraft to rearm and refuel the jets, as well as littoral areas for sea links of mobile distribution sites. For higher echelons of maintenance, F-35Bs would return from M-FARPs to rear-area friendly bases or ships. Helicopter-portable metal planking is needed to protect unprepared roads from the F-35B's exhaust; the USMC are studying lighter heat-resistant options.[285] These operations have become part of the larger USMC Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) concept.[286] The first USMC F-35C squadron, VMFA-314, achieved Full Operational Capability in July 2021 and was first deployed on board USS Abraham Lincoln as a part of Carrier Air Wing 9 in January 2022.[287] In 2024, Lt. Gen. Sami Sadat of Afghanistan described an operation using F-35Bs from USS Essex which bombed a Taliban position through cloud cover. \"The impact [the F-35] left on my soldiers was amazing. Like, whoa, you know, we have this technology\", Sadat said. \"But also the impact on the Taliban was quite crippling, because they have never seen Afghan forces move in the winter, and they have never seen planes that could bomb through the clouds.\"[288] On 9 November 2024, Marine F-35Cs carried out strikes on the Houthi movement in Yemen in the context of the Red Sea crisis, making it the first time the F-35C has been used in combat.[289] USAF F-35A in the Block 3i configuration achieved IOC with the USAF's 34th Fighter Squadron at Hill Air Force Base, Utah on 2 August 2016.[3] F-35As conducted their first Red Flag exercise in 2017; system maturity had improved and the aircraft scored a kill ratio of 15:1 against an F-16 aggressor squadron in a high-threat environment.[290] The first USAF F-35A deployment occurred on 15 April 2019 to Al Dhafra Air Base, UAE.[291] On 27 April 2019, USAF F-35As were first used in combat in an airstrike on an Islamic State tunnel network in northern Iraq.[292] For European basing, RAF Lakenheath in the UK was chosen as the first installation to station two F-35A squadrons, with 48 aircraft adding to the 48th Fighter Wing's existing F-15C and F-15E squadrons. The first aircraft of the 495th Fighter Squadron arrived on 15 December 2021.[293][294] The F-35's operating cost is higher than some older USAF tactical aircraft. In fiscal year 2018, the F-35A's cost per flight hour (CPFH) was $44,000, a number that was reduced to $35,000 in 2019.[295] For comparison, in 2015 the CPFH of the A-10 was $17,716; the F-15C, $41,921; and the F-16C, $22,514.[296] Lockheed Martin hopes to reduce it to $25,000 by 2025 through performance-based logistics and other measures.[297] According to US officials, F-35As and F-22s launched from land bases in the region, were used to attempt to draw surface-to-air missile fire ahead of B-2 bombing runs during the United States strikes on Iranian nuclear sites on 22 June 2025.[298][299][300] In January 2026, F-35s participated in the United States strikes in Venezuela, along with F-22s, B-1s, F/A-18s, E/A-18s, and various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft and drones. General Dan Caine claimed the aircraft were used to disable Venezuelan air defense systems to ensure the safe passage of the helicopters into the target area. The operation resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.[301] The USN achieved operational status with the F-35C in Block 3F on 28 February 2019.[4] On 2 August 2021, the F-35C of VFA-147, as well as the CMV-22 Osprey, embarked on their maiden deployments as part of Carrier Air Wing 2 on board USS Carl Vinson.[302] USN F-35Cs operating from the USS Carl Vinson took part the training exercise Pacific Stellar 2025 in February, along with the French and Japanese navies.[303] In April 2025, F-35C's from VFA-97 shot down multiple Houthi drones in the Red Sea, making it the first time the Navy has used the jet in combat.[304] The United Kingdom's Royal Air Force and Royal Navy operate the F-35B. Called Lightning in British service,[305] it has replaced the Harrier GR9, retired in 2010, and Tornado GR4, retired in 2019. The F-35 is to be Britain's primary strike aircraft for the next three decades. One of the Royal Navy's requirements was a Shipborne Rolling and Vertical Landing (SRVL) mode to increase maximum landing weight by using wing lift during landing.[306][307] Like the Italian Navy, British F-35Bs use ski-jumps to fly from their aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. British F-35Bs are not intended to use the Brimstone 2 missile.[308] In July 2013, Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton announced that No. 617 Squadron would be the RAF's first operational F-35 squadron.[309][310] The first British F-35 squadron was No. 17 (Reserve) Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES), which stood up on 12 April 2013 as the aircraft's Operational Evaluation Unit.[311] By June 2013, the RAF had received three F-35s of the 48 on order, initially based at Eglin Air Force Base.[312] In June 2015, the F-35B undertook its first launch from a ski-jump at NAS Patuxent River.[313] On 5 July 2017, it was announced the second UK-based RAF squadron would be No. 207 Squadron,[314] which reformed on 1 August 2019 as the Lightning Operational Conversion Unit (OCU).[315] No. 617 Squadron reformed on 18 April 2018 during a ceremony in Washington, D.C., becoming the first RAF front-line squadron to operate the type;[316] receiving its first four F-35Bs on 6 June, flying from MCAS Beaufort to RAF Marham.[317] On 10 January 2019, No. 617 Squadron and its F-35s were declared combat-ready.[318] April 2019 saw the first overseas deployment of a UK F-35 squadron when No. 617 Squadron went to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus.[319] This reportedly led on 25 June 2019 to the first combat use of an RAF F-35B: an armed reconnaissance flight searching for Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.[320] In October 2019, F-35s of 617 Squadron and No. 17 TES were embarked on HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time.[321] No. 617 Squadron departed RAF Marham on 22 January 2020 for their first Exercise Red Flag with the Lightning.[322] As of November 2022, 26 F-35Bs were based in the United Kingdom (with 617 and 207 Squadrons) and a further three were permanently based in the United States (with 17 Squadron) for testing and evaluation purposes.[323] The UK's second operational squadron is the Fleet Air Arm's 809 Naval Air Squadron, which stood up in December 2023.[324][325][326] In June 2025, as part of its second phase of procurement, the UK announced plans to procure 12 F-35As, capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear weapons, including the B61-12 thermonuclear gravity bomb. The aircraft will form part of NATO's dual capable aircraft programme. The F35-As will be based in RAF Marham, to be used in a training role on routine operation, as part of the OCU. 15 F-35Bs are also planned in this phase.[327][328][329] In July 2025, United States B61 nuclear weapons were redeployed to the US-operated RAF Lakenheath for the first time since 2008. The base operates F-35As and F-15Es, both capable of delivering the B61.[330][331] Australia's first F-35, designated A35-001, was manufactured in 2014, with flight training provided through international Pilot Training Centre (PTC) at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.[332] The first two F-35s were unveiled to the Australian public on 3 March 2017 at the Avalon Airshow.[333] By 2021, the Royal Australian Air Force had accepted 26 F-35As, with nine in the US and 17 operating at No 3 Squadron and No 2 Operational Conversion Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown.[332] With 41 trained RAAF pilots and 225 trained technicians for maintenance, the fleet was declared ready to deploy on operations.[334] It was originally expected that Australia would receive all 72 F-35s by 2023.[333] Its final nine aircraft, which were the TR-3 version, arrived in Australia in December 2024.[335] The Israeli Air Force (IAF) declared the F-35 operationally capable on 6 December 2017.[336] According to Kuwaiti newspaper Al Jarida, in July 2018, a test mission of at least three IAF F-35s flew to Iran's capital Tehran and back to Tel Aviv. While publicly unconfirmed, regional leaders acted on the report; Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei reportedly fired the air force chief and commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps over the mission.[337][338] On 22 May 2018, IAF chief Amikam Norkin said that the service had employed their F-35Is in two attacks on two battle fronts. This was part of the May 2018 Israel-Iran clashes, where airstrikes were claimed to target Iranian positions surrounding Syria's capital of Damascus and the buffer UNDOF Zone of the occupied Golan Heights.[339] This marks the first combat operation of an F-35 by any country.[14][340] Norkin said it had been flown \"all over the Middle East\", and showed photos of an F-35I flying over Beirut in daylight.[341] In July 2019, Israel expanded its strikes against Iranian missile shipments; IAF F-35Is allegedly struck Iranian targets in Iraq twice.[342] In November 2020, the IAF announced the delivery of a unique F-35I testbed aircraft among a delivery of four aircraft received in August, to be used to test and integrate Israeli-produced weapons and electronic systems on F-35s received later. This is the only example of a testbed F-35 delivered to a non-US air force.[343][344] On 11 May 2021, eight IAF F-35Is took part in an attack on 150 targets in Hamas' rocket array, including 50–70 launch pits in the northern Gaza Strip, as part of Operation Guardian of the Walls.[345] On 6 March 2022, the IDF stated that on 15 March 2021, F-35Is shot down two Iranian drones carrying weapons to the Gaza Strip.[346] This was the first operational shoot down and interception carried out by the F-35. They were also used in the Gaza war.[347][348][349] On 2 November 2023, the IDF posted on social media that they used an F-35I to shoot down a Houthi cruise missile over the Red Sea that was fired from Yemen during the Gaza war.[350] F-35Is were used in airstrikes against Lebanon, including aerial refuelling in the country's airspace, in August and September 2024, as part of the Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present).[351][155] F-35Is were used in the 29 September 2024 Israeli attacks on Yemen.[352] F-35Is were also reportedly involved in the October 2024 Israeli strikes on Iran.[353] The F-35 was also used during the June 2025 Israeli strikes on Iran, equipped with low-observable conformal fuel tanks to extend their range and allow operations over Iranian soil without mid-air refueling.[354] Iranian state-run media claimed that Iran shot down several Israeli F-35 jets, though the IDF denied the claims.[355][356] Italy's F-35As were declared to have reached initial operational capability (IOC) on 30 November 2018. At the time Italy had taken delivery of 10 F-35As and one F-35B, with 2 F-35As and the one F-35B being stationed in the U.S. for training, the remaining 8 F-35As were stationed in Amendola.[357] Italian Navy F-35Bs have been operating from the Italian aircraft carrier ITS Cavour, where they have also conducted drills in the Philippine Sea with the US in 2024.[358][359] Construction in 2023 showed that Ghedi Air Base is planning to host F-35As for Italian delivery of US B61 nuclear weapons under NATO nuclear sharing.[360] Japan's F-35As were declared to have reached initial operational capability (IOC) on 29 March 2019. At the time Japan had taken delivery of 10 F-35As stationed in Misawa Air Base. Japan plans to eventually acquire a total of 147 F-35s, which will include 42 F-35Bs. It plans to use the latter variant to equip Japan's Izumo-class multi-purpose destroyers.[361][362] On August 7, 2025, the first three Japanese F-35B's landed at Nyutabaru Air Base. Four more are to arrive by March 2026.[363] On 6 November 2019 Norway declared initial operational capability (IOC) for its fleet of 15 F-35As out of a planned 52 F-35As.[364] On 6 January 2022 Norway's F-35As replaced its older F-16A and B models for the NATO quick reaction alert mission in the high north.[365] In April 2025, the total number of F-35s delivered totaled 49 out of 52.[366][367] On 22 September 2023, two F-35As from the Royal Norwegian Air Force landed on a motorway near Tervo, Finland, showing, for the first time, that F-35As can operate from paved roads. Unlike the F-35B they cannot land vertically. The fighters were also refueled with their engines running. Major General Rolf Folland, Commander of the RNAF, said: \"Fighter jets are vulnerable on the ground, so by being able to use small airfields – and now motorways – (this) increases our survivability in war\",[368] On 27 December 2021, the Netherlands declared initial operational capability (IOC) for its fleet of 24 F-35As it has received to date from its order for 46 F-35As.[369] In 2022, the Netherlands announced they will order an additional six F-35s, totaling 52 aircraft ordered.[370] As of September 2024[update], 40 out of the 52 ordered have been delivered, and the Netherlands seeks to order another six jets to help completely phase out their F-16 fleet.[366] The F-35 was designed with three initial variants – the F-35A, a CTOL land-based version; the F-35B, a STOVL version capable of use either on land or on aircraft carriers; and the F-35C, a CATOBAR carrier-based version. Since then, there has been work on the design of nationally specific versions for Israel and Canada. The F-35A is the conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) variant intended for the USAF and other air forces. It is the smallest, lightest version and capable of 9 g, the highest of all variants. Although the F-35A currently conducts aerial refueling via boom and receptacle method, the aircraft can be modified for probe-and-drogue refueling if needed by the customer.[371][372] A drag chute pod can be installed on the F-35A, with the Royal Norwegian Air Force being the first operator to adopt it.[373] The F-35A has a tailhook designed to stop the aircraft during emergency situations. Unlike the more robust unit of the carrier-based F-35C, the F-35A's tailhook is a single-use device.[374] The F-35B is the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the aircraft. Similar in size to the A variant, the B sacrifices about a third of the A variant's fuel volume to accommodate the shaft-driven lift fan (SDLF).[375][376] This variant is limited to 7 g. Unlike other variants, the F-35B has no landing hook. The \"STOVL/HOOK\" control instead engages conversion between normal and vertical flight.[377][378] The F-35B is capable of Mach 1.6 (1,960 km/h; 1,220 mph) and can perform vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL).[218] The F-35C is the carrier-based variant of the aircraft, designed for catapult-assisted take-off and barrier-arrested recovery (CATOBAR) operations from aircraft carriers. Compared to the F-35A, the F-35C incorporates several modifications to meet the specific demands of carrier operations. These include larger wings with foldable wingtips to reduce the aircraft's footprint for storage, enlarged control surfaces for improved handling at low speeds, a more robust tailhook for repeated use with carrier arrestor cables, a twin-wheel nose gear, and reinforced landing gear to withstand the stresses of arrested landings.[249] The increased wing area also allows for lower landing speeds and improves both range and payload capacity. The F-35C is limited to a maximum load factor of 7.5 g.[379] The F-35I Adir (Hebrew: אדיר, meaning \"Awesome\",[380] or \"Mighty One\"[381]) is an F-35A with unique Israeli modifications. The US initially refused to allow such changes before permitting Israel to integrate its own electronic warfare systems, including sensors and countermeasures. The main computer has a plug-and-play function for add-on systems; proposals include an external jamming pod, and new Israeli air-to-air missiles and guided bombs in the internal weapon bays.[382][383] A senior IAF official said that the F-35's stealth may be partly overcome within 10 years despite a 30 to 40-year service life, thus Israel's insistence on using their own electronic warfare systems.[384] In 2010, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) considered a two-seat F-35 concept; an IAI executive noted that there was a \"known demand for two seats not only from Israel but from other air forces.\"[385] In 2008, IAI planned to produce conformal fuel tanks, as well as stealthy external fuel tanks;[386][387] these were reportedly used during the June 2025 Israeli airstrikes against Iran.[354] Israel had ordered a total of 75 F-35Is by 2023, with 36 already delivered as of November 2022.[388][389] The Canadian CF-35 was a proposed variant that would differ from the F-35A through the addition of a drogue parachute and the potential inclusion of an F-35B/C-style refueling probe.[373][390] In 2012, it was revealed that the CF-35 would employ the same boom refueling system as the F-35A.[391] One alternative proposal would have been the adoption of the F-35C for its probe refueling and lower landing speed; however, the Parliamentary Budget Officer's report cited the F-35C's limited performance and payload as being too high a price to pay.[392] Following the 2015 Federal Election the Liberal Party, whose campaign had included a pledge to cancel the F-35 procurement,[393] formed a new government and commenced an open competition to replace the existing CF-18 Hornet.[394] The CF-35 variant was deemed too expensive to develop, and was never considered. The Canadian government decided to not pursue any other modifications in the Future Fighter Capability Project, and instead focused on the potential procurement of the existing F-35A variant.[395] On 28 March 2022, the Canadian Government began negotiations with Lockheed Martin for 88 F-35As[396] to replace the aging fleet of CF-18 fighters starting in 2025.[397] The aircraft are reported to cost up to CA$19bn total with a life-cycle cost estimated at CA$77bn over the course of the F-35 program.[398][399] On 9 January 2023, Canada formally confirmed the purchase of 88 aircraft. The initial delivery to the Royal Canadian Air Force in 2026 will be 4 aircraft, followed by 6 aircraft each in 2027–2028, and the rest to be delivered by 2032.[400][401] The additional characteristics confirmed for the CF-35[inconsistent] included the drag chute pod for landings at short/icy arctic runways, as well as the 'sidekick' system, which allows the CF-35 to carry up to 6 x AIM-120D missiles internally (instead of the typical internal capacity of 4 x AIM-120 missiles on other variants).[402] In December 2021, it was reported that Lockheed Martin was developing a new variant for an unspecified foreign customer. The Department of Defense released US$49 million in funding for this work.[403] India The F-35 has been described as a relatively safe military aircraft.[528] Still, since 2014, more than a dozen have crashed or otherwise been involved in incidents that have killed or severely injured people or destroyed the aircraft. Some were caused by operator error; others by mechanical problems, some of which set the entire program back.[529] Data from Lockheed Martin: F-35 specifications,[530][531][532][533] Lockheed Martin: F-35 weaponry,[534] Lockheed Martin: F-35 Program Status,[117] F-35 Program brief,[167] FY2019 Select Acquisition Report (SAR),[379] Director of Operational Test & Evaluation[535] General characteristics Performance Armament Avionics Related development Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists"}

The aircraft resulted from U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) studies in 2018 to recapitalize the United States Air Force's (USAF) tactical aviation fleet that was aging due to curtailed modernization, particularly the truncated F-22 production, from post-Cold War budget cuts. The F-15EX is a variant of the F-15 Advanced Eagle, a further development of the F-15E design initially intended for export and incorporates improved internal structure, flight control system, and avionics. The aircraft is manufactured by Boeing's St. Louis division (formerly McDonnell Douglas). The Advanced Eagle began with the F-15SA (Saudi Advanced) which first flew in 2013, followed by the F-15QA (Qatari Advanced) in 2020. The F-15EX had its maiden flight in 2021 and took advantage of the active export production line to reduce costs and expedite deliveries for the USAF; it entered operational service in July 2024. The F-15EX is expected to replace the remaining F-15C/D in the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard for performing homeland and air defense missions and also serves as an affordable platform for employing large stand-off weapons to augment the frontline F-22 and F-35. The Advanced Eagle in this configuration represents the current baseline in F-15 production.[4] In the 2010s, the United States Air Force (USAF) was facing an incoming shortfall of its fighter fleet size in the 2020s due to deferred and downscaled modernization plans from budget cuts following the end of the Cold War in 1991, and the focus on asymmetric counterinsurgency warfare after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. The USAF's procurement requirement of 381 production F-22s to replace its fleet of air superiority F-15A to D fighters was curtailed to just 187 in 2009. In order to retain adequate numbers of air superiority fighters, the service planned to extend the service of 179 F-15C/Ds to the 2030s, well beyond its originally planned retirement date. Also referred to as F-15 2040C or \"Golden Eagle\", these jets would have upgraded avionics, including active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, infrared search and track (IRST), and a new electronic warfare suite called the Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS). Some of these upgrades would be shared with the F-15E fleet, such as EPAWSS whose development contract was awarded in 2015 to Boeing and BAE Systems.[5] However, by the mid-2010s, the F-15C/D fleet was aging beyond the point of economic sustainability and would not be serviceable by the 2030s due to structural fatigue, while the F-35 was facing delays, resulting in a requirement to recapitalize the fighter shortfall as legacy F-15s retire by 2026. Restarting F-22 production was considered cost prohibitive due to the high non-recurring startup costs of rebuilding the production line and sourcing replacement parts vendors.[6][7] Meanwhile, Boeing had been developing upgrades for the F-15E for export customers and a substantial update to the air vehicle design resulted in the F-15 Advanced Eagle;[8] the F-15SA (Saudi Advanced) was the initial variant which first flew in 20 February 2013, followed by the F-15QA (Qatari Advanced) ordered in 2017.[9] In 2018, following a series of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (OSD CAPE) studies indicating that a mix of fourth- and fifth-generation fighters would allow the USAF to more affordably recapitalize its fighter fleet, the USAF and Boeing began discussing the F-15X or Advanced F-15, a proposed single-seat variant based on the F-15QA to replace USAF F-15C/Ds.[10] Eventually, both single- and two-seat variants were proposed, called F-15CX and F-15EX respectively, with identical capabilities; the USAF opted for only the EX to reduce costs since only two-seat F-15 models remained in production, and in 2019, eight aircraft were included in the FY 2020 budget request.[11] This would enable the use of the existing F-15 production line with minimal non-recurring startup costs to quickly bring additional fighters into service and also was a way to support Boeing's St. Louis division in order to maintain diversity in the U.S. fighter industrial base.[12] The F-15EX improvements included the AESA radar, IRST, and EPAWSS from the existing F-15 upgrade programs while combining the benefits of the F-15QA such as the revised structure with a service life of 20,000 hours, new cockpit and flight controls, and the proposed AMBER (Advanced Missile and Bomb Ejector Rack) system to enable the carriage of up to 22 air-to-air missiles.[13] Although it is not expected to be as survivable against the latest air defenses as the fifth-generation F-22 and F-35, the F-15EX can supplement the former in air superiority missions by performing homeland and airbase defense, enforcing no-fly zones against limited air defenses, and deploying outsized standoff weapons in support of stealth fighters at the frontline.[14] In July 2020, the U.S. Defense Department ordered eight F-15EXs over three years for $1.2 billion.[15][16] The F-15EX made its maiden flight on 2 February 2021.[17][18] On 7 April 2021, its official name Eagle II was announced.[19] The FY2021 defense appropriations bill funded F-15EX procurement at $1.23 billion for 12 aircraft, bringing total orders to 20 aircraft with 144 total planned.[20] By May 2022, the USAF reduced its orders to 80.[21] The first operational F-15EXs are not to receive conformal fuel tanks.[22] The Air Force's proposed budget for fiscal 2024 includes funds to buy 24 more F-15EXs,[23] which would bring the planned fleet up to 104 aircraft.[23] In the proposed budget for FY2026, $3 billion is set aside for the F-15EX, bringing the total to 129 aircraft.[24] The F-15EX is a variant of the F-15 Advanced Eagle family of aircraft, a further development of the F-15E Strike Eagle design beginning with the F-15SA for the Royal Saudi Air Force. The Advanced Eagle consolidated several upgrades to the F-15E developed for export customers, including full integration of the General Electric F110-GE-129 and the AN/ALQ-239 Digital Electronic Warfare System (DEWS) that replaced the legacy TEWS, and introduced a revised wing structure for increased service life, an enhanced cockpit originally proposed for the F-15SE Silent Eagle and digital fly-by-wire control system that replaced the original hybrid electronic/mechanical system and enables the activation of two additional wing pylons;[25] the fly-by-wire eliminated flutter modes causing stability issues that resulted in the two outboard wing pylons being deactivated in earlier F-15 variants.[26] Starting from the F-15QA for the Qatari Emiri Air Force, the Advanced Eagle introduced a further revised wing structure that increased service life to 20,000 hours, the new Advanced Display Core Processor II (ADCP II) mission computer, and a new cockpit with a 10 in × 19 in (25 cm × 48 cm) large area display (LAD) each for the pilot and weapon systems officer (WSO). Based on the F-15QA, the F-15EX incorporates the Raytheon AN/APG-82(V)1 AESA radar, BAE Systems AN/ALQ-250 EPAWSS, and the Lockheed Martin Legion Pod with AN/ASG-34(V)1 IRST21 sensor; in contrast to some other Advanced Eagle variants, the USAF F-15EX does not have the BAE Systems AN/AAR-57 Common Missile Warning System (CMWS), although the blisters for these sensors were retained in order to minimize production changes and maintain the same aerodynamic profile for the fly-by-wire system.[27][28] The F-15EX's large payload capacity enables a high level of flexibility. In a typical air superiority or escort configuration, the Advanced Eagle can carry twelve air-to-air missiles, either the AIM-120 AMRAAM or AIM-9 Sidewinder short-range missiles; the AGM-88 HARM can also be carried. Using proposed expanded racks and CFT weapons stations, it can potentially carry sixteen AIM-120s, four AIM-9s, and two AGM-88 HARMs, although this has not been tested or funded. For precision strike, it can carry sixteen GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs, four AMRAAMs, one 2,000 lb Joint Direct Attack Munition, two HARMs, and two fuel drop tanks.[26] The F-15EX can carry multiple large standoff munitions such as the AGM-158 JASSM, or outsized munitions like the AGM-183 ARRW to bring additional firepower behind the frontline F-22 and F-35. While the Advanced Eagle's strengthened structure makes it heavier than earlier F-15 variants, the digital fly-by-wire control system and the increased dynamic thrust envelope of the F110-129 engines provide it with substantially improved maneuverability and handling characteristics over legacy F-15s and enables the pilot to maneuver aggressively with no angle-of-attack limits. The fly-by-wire also makes the aircraft much more departure-resistant and tolerant of asymmetric loads.[29][30] While not as survivable as the stealthy F-22 or F-35, the F-15EX nevertheless incorporates advanced integrated avionics and protective countermeasures systems to improve the pilot's situational awareness and increase survivability. The F-15EX's APG-82(V)1 radar, initially designated APG-63(V)4, combines the AESA antenna of the APG-63(V)3 with the processor of the APG-79(V) found on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet as well as a new cooling system and Radio Frequency Tunable Filters (RFTF) to enable simultaneous radar and electronic warfare functions while integrated with the AN/ALQ-250 EPAWSS electronic warfare suite. Leveraging the work and experience from AN/ALQ-239 DEWS, the EPAWSS is a digital system that provides all-aspect radar warning receiver function and threat geolocation; it is also integrated with the AN/ALE-47 chaff/flare countermeasures dispenser system. Both the pilot and WSO can use the Digital Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (D-JHMCS) to cue weapons at high angles off boresight. In addition to radio frequency sensors, the F-15EX can mount the Legion Pod with the ASG-34(V)1 IRST21 sensor, which provides a passive means of threat detection especially against low-observable threats in the radio-frequency spectrum; the F-15SA and F-15QA mounts the AN/AAS-42 \"Tiger Eyes\", the precursor to the IRST21 sensor, on the targeting pod pylon. While the aircraft can be operated by a single pilot for basic air superiority missions, the back seat is fully missionized to support a WSO for complex missions and can potentially support the manned-unmanned teaming coordination with uncrewed collaborative combat aircraft.[31] Although employed primarily as an air superiority fighter to replace the F-15C/D and complement the F-22, the F-15EX can employ the LANTIRN and Sniper XR pods like its F-15E precursor to perform ground attack. The avionics has an open systems architecture to facilitate potential future upgrades.[28] The first F-15EX was delivered in March 2021 and flown to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. A fleet of six aircraft formed the test force to support development and operational flight testing. The first two aircraft conducted weapons separation tests and participated in Northern Edge and Combat Hammer in May 2021 and August 2023 respectively.[32][33] The third aircraft was equipped with additional communications equipment, a redesigned forward fuselage specifically for USAF requirements, and was the first equipped with EPAWSS. The F-15EX test program is able to save time and money because many systems such as the fly-by-wire and cockpit displays were already tested on the F-15SA and F-15QA with export customer funding by Saudi Arabia and Qatar.[34][35] The F-15EX's Integrated Test & Evaluation Phase 1, which consisted of weapons trials, integration with fifth-generation fighters, and mission systems testing, was completed in August 2023; Phase 2 was cancelled due to planned aircraft upgrades of later lots and a follow-on operational test & evaluation (FOT&E) is planned.[36][37] In August 2020, the USAF announced plans to replace F-15Cs of Air National Guard units in Florida and Oregon with F-15EXs.[38][39] On 18 April 2023, the USAF announced that the California and Louisiana Air National Guards would replace their F-15C/D fleets with the F-15EX.[40] On 25 May 2023, it was announced that the 173rd Fighter Wing at Kingsley Field ANGB, Oregon, would become a Formal Training Unit (FTU) for the F-35A rather than the F-15EX. Basic F-15 training, for both the F-15E and F-15EX, will instead take place at Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina, from 2026 onwards.[41] On 5 June 2024, Oregon's 142nd Wing received its first F-15EX with the fighter landing at Portland Air National Guard Base, while the second arrived a month later. Initial operational capability was declared on 10 July 2024.[42][35][43] The Israeli Air Force ordered 25 F-15IA fighters based on the F-15EX and plans to upgrade 25 F-15Is to the F-15IA standard as of 2023.[44] In 2024, the number of new-built F-15IAs was increased to 50.[45][46][47] In addition to the 84 F-15SA purchased in 2011, Boeing discussed the sale of 54 F-15EXs to Saudi Arabia during the 2024 World Defense Show in Riyadh.[48] If the deal goes ahead, Saudi Arabia will look to upgrade their fleet of F-15SAs to the same standard as the EX.[49] A U.S. agreement to sell F-15 Advanced Eagles to Egypt for the Egyptian Air Force was announced in March 2022. A contract needs to be finalized after price and delivery date are determined.[50] On 6 November 2025, it was reported that Egypt is in talks with the US for up to 46 F-15EX Eagle II fighters with initial deliveries starting as early as 2028.[51] In February 2022, the U.S. State Department approved the sale of up to 36 F-15IDs and related equipment to Indonesia.[52] As of 21 November 2022, Indonesia's planned purchase of F-15s is in advanced stages and awaiting final sign-off from the government, as stated by the Indonesian Minister of Defense. Speaking after meeting his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Austin in Jakarta, Prabowo Subianto said that Boeing had agreed to the financial offer proposed and he is confident the package is affordable.[53] In June 2023 during a Ministry of Defense press conference it was stated that the contract for the F-15 aircraft is still in the discussion stage with the U.S. government.[54] On 21 August 2023, Boeing and the Indonesian government signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the purchase of 24 F-15EX fighters.[55] At the Polish International Defence Industry Exhibition (MSPO) in September 2023, Boeing pitched the F-15EX to Poland.[56] However, there were no specifics on price or delivery.[57] The Royal Thai Air Force is seeking multirole fighters to replace the F-16A/Bs it has in service. On 31 December 2021, the RTAF Commander-in-chief announced that the Air Force proposes to buy 8 to 12 F-35 Lightning IIs in 2023. On 12 January 2022, the council of ministers approved the first batch of four F-35As.[58] On 22 May 2023, a Royal Thai Air Force source stated that the United States Department of Defense implied it will turn down Thailand's bid to buy F-35As, and instead offer F-16 Block 70 and F-15EX Eagle II fighters.[59] In August 2024, the Royal Thai Air Force nominated the Gripen E/F to replace the service's aging F-16A/Bs.[60] This article only covers the F-15 Advanced Eagle variants. For the operators of older legacy F-15 and F-15E-based variants, such as the F-15A/B/C/D, F-15E, F-15I, F-15S, F-15K, F-15SG, see McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle.

A contract needs to be finalized after price and delivery date are determined.[50] On 6 November 2025, it was reported that Egypt is in talks with the US for up to 46 F-15EX Eagle II fighters with initial deliveries starting as early as 2028.[51] In February 2022, the U.S. State Department approved the sale of up to 36 F-15IDs and related equipment to Indonesia.[52] As of 21 November 2022, Indonesia's planned purchase of F-15s is in advanced stages and awaiting final sign-off from the government, as stated by the Indonesian Minister of Defense. Speaking after meeting his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Austin in Jakarta, Prabowo Subianto said that Boeing had agreed to the financial offer proposed and he is confident the package is affordable.[53] In June 2023 during a Ministry of Defense press conference it was stated that the contract for the F-15 aircraft is still in the discussion stage with the U.S. government.[54] On 21 August 2023, Boeing and the Indonesian government signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the purchase of 24 F-15EX fighters.[55] At the Polish International Defence Industry Exhibition (MSPO) in September 2023, Boeing pitched the F-15EX to Poland.[56] However, there were no specifics on price or delivery.[57] The Royal Thai Air Force is seeking multirole fighters to replace the F-16A/Bs it has in service. On 31 December 2021, the RTAF Commander-in-chief announced that the Air Force proposes to buy 8 to 12 F-35 Lightning IIs in 2023. On 12 January 2022, the council of ministers approved the first batch of four F-35As.[58] On 22 May 2023, a Royal Thai Air Force source stated that the United States Department of Defense implied it will turn down Thailand's bid to buy F-35As, and instead offer F-16 Block 70 and F-15EX Eagle II fighters.[59] In August 2024, the Royal Thai Air Force nominated the Gripen E/F to replace the service's aging F-16A/Bs.[60] This article only covers the F-15 Advanced Eagle variants. For the operators of older legacy F-15 and F-15E-based variants, such as the F-15A/B/C/D, F-15E, F-15I, F-15S, F-15K, F-15SG, see McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle.

Part of the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) program, it is to be a stealth intercontinental strategic bomber that can deliver conventional and thermonuclear weapons. Named \"Raider\" after the Doolittle Raiders of World War II, the B-21 is meant to complement the Rockwell B-1 Lancer and Northrop B-2 Spirit, replace them by 2040, and possibly replace the 1950s Boeing B-52 Stratofortress after that. The B-21 is a flying wing and lambda wing, similar to its B-2 predecessor, while being smaller and lighter. Unlike previous bombers, the B-21 is designed primarily considering Indo-Pacific Command operations in a potential conflict with China. It will carry the AGM-181 LRSO strategic nuclear cruise missile, the B61 Mod 12 and Mod 13 strategic/tactical nuclear bombs, and a range of conventional ordnance including the AGM-158 JASSM-ER cruise missile. The B-21 emerged from the Air Force's Long Range Strike Bomber program, which began in 2011 and awarded Northrop Grumman the major development contract in 2015. The USAF aimed to have the aircraft in service \"in the mid-2020s\".[4] By 2021, that date had slipped to 2027.[5] The B-21 is part of the US effort to modernize its nuclear triad, along with the LGM-35 Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile and Columbia-class submarine. The B-21 is expected to double the US nuclear-capable bomber fleet from 60 to 120.[6] As of 2025[update], many aspects of the B-21 special access program were still highly classified, though some information has been made public since 2015. The first B-21 aircraft was unveiled in December 2022 at Northrop Grumman's production facilities in Palmdale, California. The first flight of a B-21 took place on 10 November 2023. Two other B-21s were in ground testing by September 2024, and a second B-21 took flight a year later. The Air Force launched the classified Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) program in 2011[7] to create a stealthy intercontinental strategic bomber that could deliver conventional and thermonuclear weapons.[8] The service issued a request for proposals to develop an LRS-B aircraft in July 2014[7][9] and awarded a development contract to Northrop Grumman in October 2015.[10] The contract award was protested by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, who had submitted a joint bid[11], but a year later the Government Accountability Office (GAO) sustained the USAF's decision. The GAO report revealed that cost was the deciding factor in selecting Northrop Grumman over the Boeing-Lockheed Martin team.[12][13] Management and acquisition of the B-21 program is overseen by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, rather than through the traditional military-procurement process.[14] The program remains subject to the Nunn–McCurdy reporting requirements to the US Congress.[14] A 2015 media report said the Air Force wanted the bomber to also function as an intelligence collection platform, battle manager, and interceptor aircraft.[10] In 2016, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said the B-21 would be a \"fifth-generation global precision attack platform\" with networked sensor-shoot capability.[9] Northrop Grumman describes the B-21 as \"the world's first sixth-generation aircraft.\"[15] At the 2016 Air Warfare Symposium, Air Force officials announced that the LRS-B would be designated \"B-21\" because it would be the 21st century's first bomber.[16] In September 2016, Air Force officials announced that the B-21 would be named \"Raider\" in honor of the Doolittle Raiders.[17] Retired Lt. Col. Richard E. Cole, the last member of the Doolittle Raiders then living, was present at the naming ceremony at the Air Force Association conference.[18] In March 2016, the USAF announced seven tier-one suppliers for the program: Pratt & Whitney, BAE Systems, Spirit AeroSystems, Orbital ATK, Rockwell Collins, GKN Aerospace, and Janicki Industries.[19][20] In 2016, the F-35 program manager Chris Bogdan said the B-21's engines would be similar enough to the F-35's Pratt & Whitney F135 engine to reduce its cost.[21] The program completed its critical design review in December 2018.[22] In January 2020, Air Force officials released new B-21 renderings, showing the distinctive flush and blended inlets and the two-wheel main landing gear design. The drawing appeared to show a smaller, lighter aircraft than the B-2.[23][24] Similar to the B-2, it is a flying wing and lambda wing design.[25] In February 2016, the head of the Air Force Global Strike Command said he expected the service would place an initial order for 100 B-21s and build up to a full fleet of 175 to 200.[26][9] In 2017, two USAF studies suggested that the Air Force could increase its initial purchase from 80-to-100 to 145 aircraft.[27] The B-21 is assembled at the USAF Plant 42 near Palmdale, California, at the same facility Northrop Grumman used during the 1980s and 1990s to build B-2 bombers.[14][28] In January 2017, Northrop Grumman was awarded a $35.8 million contract modification for a large coatings facility at Plant 42, to be completed by the end of 2019. The contract announcement did not mention the B-21, but the facility is thought likely to be for B-21 stealth coating.[29] By the summer of 2019, it was reported that construction of the first aircraft was underway.[30] In early 2021, several media outlets reported that as completion of the first B-21 approached, construction on the second unit had begun.[31][32] At a congressional hearing in June 2021, Darlene Costello, the acting Assistant Secretary of the Air Force Acquisition, Technology & Logistics, confirmed that the first two B-21s were under construction at Plant 42.[33][34] By February 2022, six B-21s were under construction.[35][36] The first B-21 was moved to a calibration facility the following month.[37] About 8,000 Northrop Grumman employees had worked on the program with more than 400 suppliers from at least 40 states.[15] The first B-21 test aircraft was unveiled at Northrop Grumman's production facilities in Palmdale, California, on 2 December 2022.[38][39][40] At the unveiling, Northrop CEO Kathy Warden said that the B-21 is designed with modular, open systems architecture to allow easy upgrades[a] and, potentially, the ability to export components to foreign buyers.[42] Warden said that the B-21's internal operations were \"extremely advanced compared to the B-2\" and that the B-21 was slightly smaller than the B-2, but the range was longer.[39] The first B-21s are not prototypes but rather test aircraft that the Air Force will convert to operational configuration after the completion of tests.[38][43] In September 2023, program officials said fueling and engine tests were proceeding ahead of the anticipated first flight by year's end.[44] The first test flight of the B-21 took place on 10 November 2023 at the Air Force's Plant 42 in Palmdale, California.[45] On 23 January 2024, a low rate initial production (LRIP) contract was awarded.[1][quantify] In July 2016, the USAF said it would not release the estimated cost of Northrop's B-21 contract as the number would reveal too much about the classified project to potential adversaries. The Senate Armed Services Committee also voted to not publicly release the program's cost, restricting the information to congressional defense committees, over the objections of a bipartisan group of legislators led by the committee's chairman, Senator John McCain.[46] McCain's proposed revisions to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 would have reduced authorization for the B-21 program by $302 million \"due to a lower-than-expected contract award value\", while requiring \"strict ... program baseline and cost control thresholds\", \"quarterly program performance reports\", and \"disclosure of the engineering and manufacturing development total contract award value\".[47] The versions of the 2017 NDAA as initially passed by the House and Senate would have required public disclosure of the total cost of the B-21, but this provision was removed in the final conference report version.[14] In December 2022, the cost of the B-21 was estimated at $700 million per aircraft.[48] At the time, Air Force officials estimated that they would spend at least $203 billion over 30 years to develop, purchase, and operate a fleet of at least 100 B-21s.[28] Maintenance and sustainment of the B-21[a] will be coordinated by Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, while Edwards Air Force Base, California, will lead testing and evaluation.[49] The B-21 is expected to operate from bases that currently host heavy bombers, such as Dyess Air Force Base, Texas; Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota; and Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri.[50] In March 2019, Ellsworth was selected as the base to host the first operational B-21 unit, as well as the first training unit.[51] The B-21 is intended by 2040 to replace the US Air Force's 45 B-1 strategic bombers, which date from the 1980s, and 19 B-2 strategic bombers, which date from the 1990s. The B-21 may also eventually replace the USAF's 72 B-52 bombers, which originally date from the 1950s and as of 2022[update] are planned to remain in service for many further decades.[14][52] The USAF plans to replace its bomber fleet and most of the service's nuclear delivery weapons, including its intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The Air Force is focusing on Indo-Pacific operations around the B-21. Officials say is a crucial platform in a potential conflict with China, while the B-2 Spirit was developed considering conflict with the Soviet Union.[53][54][55] The B-21 will be assigned to carry the AGM-181 LRSO nuclear air-to-ground cruise missile,[56] the B61 Mod 12 nuclear glide bomb,[56] and the B61 Mod 13 nuclear bunker buster.[57] The LRSO will also be assigned to the B-52 but not the B-2,[58] and is expected to have a range of at least 1,500 mi (2,400 km).[59] The B61 Mod 12 is also assigned to the B-2 and a range of fighters including the F-35, but the F-35 will not carry the Mod 13.[57] The B-21 will be able to carry conventional weapons, including the AGM-158 JASSM-ER extended-range variant,[56] capable of at least 620 mi (1,000 km).[60] In March 2022, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall III raised the possibility of a bomber drone to work with the bomber,[61][62] but the idea was later dropped because it would not save much money to produce such a large, unmanned aircraft.[63] The USAF was as of 2016[update] also planning to acquire a new long-range fighter from its Next Generation Air Dominance program, known as the F-X or \"Penetrating Counter-Air\", to escort the B-21 deep into enemy territory and help it survive enemy air defenses and intercepting fighters.[64] In December 2022, an Australian Strategic Policy Institute report advocated acquiring a number of B-21 Raiders to provide the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) a greater long-range strike capability.[65] The report stated that a B-21 could fly 2,500 miles (4,000 km) without refueling while carrying more munitions than the maximum 930-mile (1,500 km) range of the RAAF's F-35 fighter jets, which require air-to-air refueling for longer missions. A single B-21 can also deliver the same impact as several F-35As. Additionally, the B-21 can attack targets from secure air bases located in Australia's south, with greater proximity to more personnel, fuel, and munitions.[66] During bilateral talks held in August 2022, it was reported that the US might allow Australia to procure the B-21. When asked if the US would consider allowing Australia to join in developing the B-21 bomber, USAF Secretary Frank Kendall stated, \"I don't think that there's any fundamental limitation on the areas in which we can cooperate. If Australia had a requirement for long-range strike, then we'd be willing to have a conversation with them about that.\"[67] However, the Defence Strategic Review released by the Australian government on 24 April 2023 stated that the B-21 was not considered a suitable option for acquisition.[68] Australia will instead invest in upgrading its F-35As and F/A-18Fs to the latest Block 4 and Block III configurations, respectively, to enable both aircraft to launch the AGM-158C LRASM and the Joint Strike Missile.[69] As part of an Institute of Public Affairs paper released in August 2024, the first of six recommendations encouraged the Australian government to reconsider its position on the Raider and states that it should purchase the Raider to reconcile a long-range strike gap should the AUKUS program have delays.[70] The test program is managed by the US Air Force Test Center and the 412th Test Wing's B-21 Combined Test Force, which includes Northrop Grumman personnel.[71][72] The B-21 took its maiden flight on 10 November 2023.[73] On 17 January 2024, the B-21 flew its second publicly acknowledged test flight, from Edwards Air Force Base.[53] By September 2024, three test aircraft were in service: one performing one or two flight tests per week, and the others involved in ground tests.[74] On 11 September 2025, the second B-21 conducted its maiden flight.[75] Data from Aviation Week & Space Technology[78] General characteristics Performance Armament Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists"}

It is often referred to as a stealth bomber.[3][A] A subsonic flying wing and lambda wing with a crew of two, the B-2 was designed by Northrop (later Northrop Grumman) as the prime contractor, with Boeing, Hughes Aircraft Company, and Vought as principal subcontractors. It was produced from 1988 to 2000.[6][1][7] The bomber can drop conventional and thermonuclear weapons,[8] such as up to eighty 500-pound class (230 kg) Mk 82 JDAM GPS-guided bombs, or sixteen 2,400-pound (1,100 kg) B83 nuclear bombs. The B-2 is the only acknowledged in-service aircraft that can carry large air-to-surface standoff weapons in a stealth configuration. Development began under the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) project during the Carter administration, which cancelled the Mach 2-capable B-1A bomber in part because the ATB showed such promise, but development difficulties delayed progress and drove up costs. Ultimately, the program produced 21 B-2s at an average cost of $2.13 billion each (~$4.17 billion in 2024 dollars), including development, engineering, testing, production, and procurement.[9] Building each aircraft cost an average of US$737 million,[9] while total procurement costs (including production, spare parts, equipment, retrofitting, and software support) averaged $929 million (~$1.14 billion in 2024 dollars) per plane.[9] The project's considerable capital and operating costs made it controversial in the U.S. Congress even before the winding down of the Cold War dramatically reduced the desire for a stealth aircraft designed to strike deep in Soviet territory. Consequently, in the late 1980s and 1990s lawmakers shrank the planned purchase of 132 bombers to 21. The B-2 can perform attack missions at altitudes of up to 50,000 feet (15,000 m); it has an unrefueled range of more than 6,000 nautical miles (11,000 km; 6,900 mi) and can fly more than 10,000 nautical miles (19,000 km; 12,000 mi) with one midair refueling. It entered service in 1997 as the second aircraft designed with advanced stealth technology, after the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk attack aircraft. Primarily designed as a nuclear bomber, the B-2 was first used in combat to drop conventional, non-nuclear ordnance in the Kosovo War in 1999. It was later used in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, and Iran.[10][11] The United States Air Force has nineteen B-2s in service as of 2024.[12] One was destroyed in a 2008 crash,[13][14] and another was likely retired from service after being damaged in a crash in 2022.[12] The Air Force plans to operate the B-2s until 2032, when the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider is to replace them.[15] By the mid-1970s, military aircraft designers had learned of a new method to avoid missiles and interceptors, known today as \"stealth\". The concept was to build an aircraft with an airframe that deflected or absorbed radar signals so that little was reflected back to the radar unit. An aircraft having radar stealth characteristics would be able to fly nearly undetected and could be attacked only by weapons and systems not relying on radar. Although other detection measures existed, such as human observation, infrared scanners, and acoustic locators, their relatively short detection range or poorly developed technology allowed most aircraft to fly undetected, or at least untracked, especially at night.[16] In 1974, DARPA requested information from U.S. aviation firms about the largest radar cross-section of an aircraft that would remain effectively invisible to radars.[17] Initially, Northrop and McDonnell Douglas were selected for further development. Lockheed had experience in this field with the development of the Lockheed A-12 and SR-71, which included several stealthy features, notably its canted vertical stabilizers, the use of composite materials in key locations, and the overall surface finish in radar-absorbing paint. A key improvement was the introduction of computer models used to predict the radar reflections from flat surfaces where collected data drove the design of a \"faceted\" aircraft. Development of the first such designs started in 1975 with the Have Blue, a model Lockheed built to test the concept.[18] Plans were well advanced by the summer of 1975, when DARPA started the Experimental Survivability Testbed project. Northrop and Lockheed were awarded contracts in the first round of testing. Lockheed received the sole award for the second test round in April 1976 leading to the Have Blue program and eventually the F-117 stealth attack aircraft.[19] Northrop also had a classified technology demonstration aircraft, the Tacit Blue in development in 1979 at Area 51. It developed stealth technology, LO (low observables), fly-by-wire, curved surfaces, composite materials, electronic intelligence, and Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft Experimental. The stealth technology developed from the program was later incorporated into other operational aircraft designs, including the B-2 stealth bomber.[20] By 1976, these programs had progressed to a position in which a long-range strategic stealth bomber appeared viable. U.S. president Jimmy Carter became aware of these developments during 1977, and it appears to have been one of the major reasons the B-1 was canceled.[21] Further studies were ordered in early 1978, by which point the Have Blue platform had flown and proven the concepts. During the 1980 U.S. presidential election campaign in 1979, Ronald Reagan repeatedly stated that Carter was weak on defense and used the B-1 as a prime example. In response, on 22 August 1980 the Carter administration publicly disclosed that the United States Department of Defense was working to develop stealth aircraft, including a bomber.[22] The Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) program began in 1979.[23] Full development of the black project followed, funded under the code name \"Aurora\".[24] After the evaluations of the companies' proposals, the ATB competition was narrowed to the Northrop/Boeing and Lockheed/Rockwell teams with each receiving a study contract for further work.[23] Both teams used flying wing designs.[24] The Northrop proposal was code named \"Senior Ice\", and the Lockheed proposal code named \"Senior Peg\".[25] Northrop had experience developing flying wing aircraft: the YB-35 and YB-49.[26] The Northrop design was larger and had curved surfaces while the Lockheed design was faceted and included a small tail.[24] In 1979, designer Hal Markarian produced a sketch of the aircraft that bore considerable similarities to the final design.[27] The final design would become one of the first combat aircraft to use a lambda wing design.[28] The United States Air Force (USAF) originally planned to procure 165 ATB bombers.[1] The Northrop team's ATB design was selected over the Lockheed/Rockwell design on 20 October 1981.[23][29] The Northrop design received the designation B-2 and the name \"Spirit\". The bomber's design was changed in the mid-1980s when the mission profile was changed from high-altitude to low-altitude, terrain-following. The redesign delayed the B-2's first flight by two years and added about US$1 billion to the program's cost.[22] By 1989, the U.S. had secretly spent an estimated US$23 billion on research and development for the B-2.[30] MIT engineers and scientists helped assess the mission effectiveness of the aircraft under a five-year classified contract during the 1980s.[31] ATB technology was also fed into the Advanced Tactical Fighter program, which would produce the Lockheed YF-22 and Northrop YF-23, and later the Lockheed Martin F-22. Northrop was the B-2's prime contractor; major subcontractors included Boeing, Hughes Aircraft (now Raytheon), General Electric Aviation, and Vought Aircraft.[10] During its design and development, the Northrop B-2 program was a black project; all program personnel needed a secret clearance.[32] Still, it was less closely held than the Lockheed F-117 program; more people in the federal government knew about the B-2, and more information about the project was available. Both during development and in service, considerable effort has been devoted to maintaining the security of the B-2's design and technologies. Staff working on the B-2 in most, if not all, capacities need a level of special-access clearance and undergo extensive background checks carried out by a special branch of the USAF.[33] A former Ford automobile assembly plant in Pico Rivera, California, was acquired and substantially rebuilt; the plant's employees were sworn to secrecy. To avoid suspicion, components were typically purchased through front companies, military officials would visit out of uniform, staff members were routinely subjected to polygraph examinations, and the business unit was named the \"Advanced Systems Division\". Nearly all information on the program was kept from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and members of Congress until the mid-1980s.[34] The B-2 was first publicly displayed on 22 November 1988 at USAF Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, where it was assembled. This viewing was heavily restricted, and guests were not allowed to see the rear of the B-2. However, Aviation Week editors found that there were no airspace restrictions above the presentation area and took aerial photographs of the aircraft's secret rear section[35] with suppressed engine exhausts.[6] The B-2's (s/n 82-1066 / AV-1) first public flight was on 17 July 1989 from Palmdale to Edwards Air Force Base.[35] In 1984, Northrop employee Thomas Patrick Cavanagh was arrested for attempting to sell classified information from the Pico Rivera factory to the Soviet Union.[36] In October 2005, Noshir Gowadia, a design engineer who worked on the B-2's propulsion system, was arrested for selling classified information to China.[37] Gowadia was convicted and sentenced to 32 years in prison.[38] A procurement of 132 aircraft was planned in the mid-1980s but was later reduced to 75.[39] By the early 1990s the Soviet Union dissolved, effectively eliminating the Spirit's primary Cold War mission. Under budgetary pressures and U.S. Congressional opposition, in his 1992 State of the Union address, President George H. W. Bush announced B-2 production would be limited to 20 aircraft.[40] In 1996, however, the Clinton administration, though originally committed to ending production of the bombers at 20 aircraft, authorized the conversion of a 21st bomber, a prototype test model, to Block 30 fully operational status at a cost of nearly $500 million (~$920 million in 2024 dollars).[41] In 1995, Northrop made a proposal to the USAF to build 20 additional aircraft with a flyaway cost of $566 million each.[42] The program was the subject of public controversy for its cost to American taxpayers. In 1996, the GAO disclosed that the USAF's B-2 bombers \"will be, by far, the costliest bombers to operate on a per aircraft basis\", costing over three times as much as the B-1B (US$9.6 million annually) and over four times as much as the B-52H (US$6.8 million annually). In September 1997, each hour of B-2 flight necessitated 119 hours of maintenance. Comparable maintenance needs for the B-52 and the B-1B are 53 and 60 hours, respectively, for each hour of flight. A key reason for this cost is the provision of air-conditioned hangars large enough for the bomber's 172 ft (52 m) wingspan, which are needed to maintain the aircraft's stealth properties, particularly its \"low-observable\" stealth skins.[43][44] Maintenance costs are about $3.4 million per month for each aircraft.[45] An August 1995 GAO report disclosed that the B-2 had trouble operating in heavy rain, as rain could damage the aircraft's stealth coating, causing procurement delays until an adequate protective coating could be found. In addition, the B-2's terrain-following/terrain-avoidance radar had difficulty distinguishing rain from other obstacles, rendering the subsystem inoperable during rain.[46] However a subsequent report in October 1996 noted that the USAF had made some progress in resolving the issues with the radar via software fixes and hoped to have these fixes undergoing tests by the spring of 1997.[47] The total \"military construction\" cost related to the program was projected to be US$553.6 million in 1997 dollars. The cost to procure each B-2 was US$737 million in 1997 dollars (equivalent to US$1.334 billion in 2021)[48], based only on a fleet cost of US$15.48 billion.[9] The procurement cost per aircraft, as detailed in GAO reports, which include spare parts and software support, was $929 million per aircraft in 1997 dollars.[9] The total program cost projected through 2004 was US$44.75 billion in 1997 dollars (equivalent to US$81 billion in 2021)[48]. This includes development, procurement, facilities, construction, and spare parts. The total program cost averaged US$2.13 billion per aircraft.[9] The B-2 may cost up to $135,000 per flight hour to operate in 2010, which is about twice that of the B-52 and B-1.[49][50] In its consideration of the fiscal year 1990 defense budget, the U.S. House of Representative Armed Services Committee trimmed $800 million from the B-2 research and development budget, while at the same time staving off a motion to end the project. Opposition in committee and in Congress was mostly broad and bipartisan, with Congressmen Ron Dellums (D-CA), John Kasich (R-OH), and John G. Rowland (R-CT) authorizing the motion to end the project—as well as others in the Senate, including Jim Exon (D-NE) and John McCain (R-AZ) also opposing the project.[51] Dellums and Kasich, in particular, worked together from 1989 through the early 1990s to limit production to 21 aircraft and were ultimately successful.[52] The escalating cost of the B-2 program and evidence of flaws in the aircraft's ability to elude detection by radar[51] were among factors that drove opposition to continue the program. At the peak production period specified in 1989, the schedule called for spending US$7 billion to $8 billion per year in 1989 dollars, something committee Chair Les Aspin (D-WI) said \"won't fly financially\".[53] In 1990, the Department of Defense accused Northrop of using faulty components in the flight control system; it was also found that redesign work was required to reduce the risk of damage to engine fan blades by bird ingestion.[54] In time, several prominent members of Congress began to oppose the program's expansion, including Senator John Kerry (D-MA), who cast votes against the B-2 in 1989, 1991, and 1992. By 1992, U.S. president Bush had called for the cancellation of the B-2 and promised to cut military spending by 30% in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union.[55] In October 1995, former Chief of Staff of the USAF, General Mike Ryan, and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, strongly recommended against Congressional action to fund the purchase of any additional B-2s, arguing that to do so would require unacceptable cuts in existing conventional and nuclear-capable aircraft,[56] and that the military had greater priorities in spending a limited budget.[57] Some B-2 advocates argued that procuring twenty additional aircraft would save money because B-2s would be able to deeply penetrate anti-aircraft defenses and use low-cost, short-range attack weapons rather than expensive standoff weapons. However, in 1995, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and its Director of National Security Analysis found that additional B-2s would reduce the cost of expended munitions by less than US$2 billion in 1995 dollars during the first two weeks of a conflict, in which the USAF predicted bombers would make their greatest contribution; this was a small fraction of the US$26.8 billion (in 1995 dollars) life cycle cost that the CBO projected for an additional 20 B-2s.[58] In 1997, as Ranking Member of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee and National Security Committee, Congressman Ron Dellums (D-CA), a long-time opponent of the bomber, cited five independent studies and offered an amendment to that year's defense authorization bill to cap production of the bombers to the existing 21 aircraft; the amendment was narrowly defeated.[59] Nonetheless, Congress did not approve funding for additional B-2s. Several upgrade packages have been applied to the B-2. In July 2008, the B-2's onboard computing architecture was extensively redesigned; it now incorporates a new integrated processing unit that communicates with systems throughout the aircraft via a newly installed fiber optic network; a new version of the operational flight program software was also developed, with legacy code converted from the JOVIAL programming language to standard C.[60][61] Updates were also made to the weapon control systems to enable strikes upon moving targets, such as ground vehicles.[62] On 29 December 2008, USAF officials awarded a US$468 million contract to Northrop Grumman to modernize the B-2 fleet's radars.[63] Changing the radar's frequency was required as the United States Department of Commerce had sold that radio spectrum to another operator.[64] In July 2009, it was reported that the B-2 had successfully passed a major USAF audit.[65] In 2010, it was made public that the Air Force Research Laboratory had developed a new material to be used on the part of the wing trailing edge subject to engine exhaust, replacing existing material that quickly degraded.[66] In July 2010, political analyst Rebecca Grant speculated that when the B-2 becomes unable to reliably penetrate enemy defenses, the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II may take on its strike/interdiction mission, carrying B61 nuclear bombs as a tactical bomber.[67] However, in March 2012, The Pentagon announced that a $2 billion, 10-year-long modernization of the B-2 fleet was to begin. The main area of improvement would be replacement of outdated avionics and equipment.[68] Continued modernization efforts likely have continued in secret, as alluded to by a B-2 commander from Whiteman Air Force Base in April 2021, possibly indicating offensive weapons capability against threatening air defenses and aircraft. He stated: without getting into specifics, and without getting into things that we frankly just don't discuss in open channels, I will tell you that our current bomber fleet, and this is all of them, we use some pretty innovative ways to integrate modern weapons capabilities to have us both maintain and increase our survivability. And for the B-2 specifically, the expansion of some of our strike capabilities allow us to increase our survivability beyond the fighter escort realm. Now the B-2 fleet is continuing to do that technological advancement, and that's enabled us to expand our strike capabilities, as well. Although we've been around for over 30 years, there's a lot of life left in this platform, and up until the B-21 is well on the scene and doing its job, this aircraft will continue to be at the forefront of our country and our nation's defense... and with these, and continued innovative upgrades, and weapons system capabilities, we will continue to do that until the last jet flies off the ramp into retirement.[69] It was reported in 2011 that The Pentagon was evaluating an unmanned stealth bomber, characterized as a \"mini-B-2\", as a potential replacement in the near future.[70] In 2012, USAF Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz stated the B-2's 1980s-era stealth technologies would make it less survivable in future contested airspaces, so the USAF is to proceed with the Next-Generation Bomber despite overall budget cuts.[71] In 2012 projections, it was estimated that the Next-Generation Bomber would have an overall cost of $55 billion.[72] In 2013, the USAF contracted for the Defensive Management System Modernization (DMS-M) program to replace the antenna system and other electronics to increase the B-2's frequency awareness.[73] The Common Very Low Frequency Receiver upgrade allows the B-2s to use the same very low frequency transmissions as the Ohio-class submarines so as to continue in the nuclear mission until the Mobile User Objective System is fielded.[citation needed] In 2014, the USAF outlined a series of upgrades including nuclear warfighting, a new integrated processing unit, the ability to carry cruise missiles, and threat warning improvements.[74] Due to ongoing software challenges, DMS-M was canceled by 2020, and the existing work was repurposed for cockpit upgrades.[75] In 1998, a Congressional panel advised the USAF to refocus resources away from continued B-2 production and instead begin development of a new bomber, either a new build or a variant of the B-2. In its 1999 bomber roadmap the USAF eschewed the panel's recommendations, believing its current bomber fleet could be maintained until the 2030s. The service believed that development could begin in 2013, in time to replace aging B-2s, B-1s and B-52s around 2037.[76][77] Although the USAF previously planned to operate the B-2 until 2058, the FY 2019 budget moved up its retirement to \"no later than 2032\". It also moved the retirement of the B-1 to 2036 while extending the B-52's service life into the 2050s, because the B-52 has lower maintenance costs, versatile conventional payload, and the ability to carry nuclear cruise missiles (which the B-1 is treaty-prohibited from doing). The decision to retire the B-2 early was made because the small fleet of 20 is considered too expensive per plane to retain, with its position as a stealth bomber being taken over with the introduction of the B-21 Raider starting in the mid-2020s.[15] The B-2 Spirit was developed to take over the USAF's vital penetration missions, allowing it to travel deep into enemy territory to deploy ordnance, which could include nuclear weapons.[78] The B-2 is a flying wing aircraft, meaning that it has no fuselage or tail.[78] It has significant advantages over previous bombers due to its blend of low-observable technologies with high aerodynamic efficiency and a large payload. Low observability provides greater freedom of action at high altitudes, thus increasing both range and field of view for onboard sensors. The USAF reports its range as about 6,000 nautical miles (6,900 mi; 11,000 km).[10][79] At cruising altitude, the B-2 refuels every six hours, taking on up to 50 short tons (45,000 kg) of fuel at a time.[80] The development and construction of the B-2 required pioneering use of computer-aided design and manufacturing technologies due to its complex flight characteristics and design requirements to maintain very low visibility to multiple means of detection.[78][81] The B-2 bears a resemblance to earlier Northrop aircraft; the YB-35 and YB-49 were both flying wing bombers that had been canceled in development in the early 1950s,[82] allegedly for political reasons.[83] The resemblance goes as far as B-2 and YB-49 having the same wingspan.[84][85] The YB-49 also had a small radar cross-section.[86][87] About 80 pilots fly the B-2.[80] Each aircraft has a crew of two, a pilot in the left seat and mission commander in the right,[10] and has provisions for a third crew member if needed.[88] For comparison, the B-1B has a crew of four and the B-52 has a crew of five.[10] The B-2 is highly automated, and one crew member can sleep in a camp bed, use a toilet, or prepare a hot meal while the other monitors the aircraft, unlike most two-seat aircraft. Extensive sleep cycle and fatigue research was conducted to improve crew performance on long sorties.[80][89][90] Advanced training is conducted at the USAF Weapons School.[91] In the envisaged Cold War scenario, the B-2 was to perform deep-penetrating nuclear strike missions, making use of its stealth capabilities to avoid detection and interception throughout the missions.[92] There are two internal bomb bays in which munitions are stored either on a rotary launcher or two bomb-racks; the carriage of the weapons loadouts internally results in less radar visibility than external mounting of munitions.[93][94] The B-2 is capable of carrying 40,000 lb (18,000 kg) of ordnance.[10] Nuclear ordnance includes the B61 and B83 nuclear bombs; the AGM-129 ACM cruise missile was also intended for use on the B-2 platform.[94][95] After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it was decided to equip the B-2 for conventional precision attacks as well as for the strategic role of nuclear-strike.[92][96] The B-2 has a sophisticated GPS-Aided Targeting System (GATS) that uses the aircraft's APQ-181 synthetic aperture radar to map out targets before dropping GPS-aided bombs (GAMs)—later, Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs). In the B-2's original configuration, up to 16 GAMs or JDAMs could be deployed;[97] An upgrade in 2004 raised the carrier capacity to 80 JDAMs.[98] The B-2 can drop various conventional weapons, including Mark 82 and Mark 84 bombs, CBU-87 Combined Effects Munitions, GATOR mines, and the CBU-97 Sensor Fuzed Weapon.[99] In July 2009, Northrop Grumman reported the B-2 was compatible with the equipment necessary to deploy the 30,000 lb (14,000 kg) Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), which is intended to attack reinforced bunkers; up to two MOPs could be equipped in the B-2's bomb bays with one per bay,[100] the B-2 is the only platform compatible with the MOP as of 2012.[68] As of 2011, the AGM-158 JASSM cruise missile is an upcoming standoff munition to be deployed on the B-2 and other platforms.[101] This is to be followed by the Long Range Standoff Weapon, which may give the B-2 standoff nuclear capability for the first time,[102][103] in a stealth configuration. To make the B-2 more effective than previous bombers, advanced and modern avionics were integrated into its design; these have been modified and improved to accommodate conventional-warfare missions. The low-probability-of-intercept AN/APQ-181 multi-mode radar is part of a digital navigation system that includes terrain-following radar and Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance, NAS-26 astro-inertial navigation system (developed in the 1950s for the Northrop SM-62 Snark cruise missile),[104] and a Defensive Management System (DMS) to inform the flight crew of possible threats.[98] The DMS can automatically assess the detection capabilities of identified threats and indicated targets.[105] The DMS was to be upgraded by 2021 to detect radar emissions from air defenses, then feed the data to the auto-router so it can modify the mission route to minimize exposure to dangers.[106] For safety and fault detection, an onboard test system is linked with most of the B-2's avionics to monitor the performance and status of thousands of components and consumables; it also provides post-mission servicing instructions to ground crews.[107] In 2008, many of the 136[108] standalone distributed computers aboard the B-2, including the primary flight management computer, were being replaced by a single system.[109] The avionics are controlled by 13 EMP-resistant MIL-STD-1750A computers connected through 26 MIL-STD-1553B-buses; other system elements are connected via optical fiber.[110] In addition to software upgrades and new radar-absorbent materials, the B-2 has had several major upgrades to its avionics and combat systems. For battlefield communications, Link-16 and a high-frequency satellite link have been installed. New munitions have been integrated. The AN/APQ-181 was given new antenna arrays to turn it into an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar,[111] and its operational frequency was changed to avoid interfering with other operators' equipment.[98] The B-2's composite structure requires it to stay 40 miles (64 km) away from thunderstorms to avoid static discharge and lightning strikes.[91] Because flying wing aircraft are inherently unstable, the B-2 uses a complex quadruplex computer-controlled fly-by-wire flight control system that can automatically manipulate flight surfaces and settings without direct pilot inputs to maintain aircraft stability.[112] The flight computer receives information on external conditions such as the aircraft's air speed and angle of attack via pitot-static sensing plates, as opposed to traditional pitot tubes which would impair the aircraft's stealth capabilities.[113] The flight actuation system incorporates hydraulic and electrical servoactuated components, and it was designed with a high level of redundancy and fault-diagnostic capabilities.[114] Northrop had investigated several means of applying directional control that would raise the aircraft's radar profile as little as possible, eventually settling on a combination of split brake-rudders and differential thrust.[105] Engine thrust became a key element of the B-2's aerodynamic design process early on; thrust not only affects drag and lift but pitching and rolling motions as well.[115] Four pairs of control surfaces are located along the wing's trailing edge; while most surfaces are used throughout the aircraft's flight envelope, the inner elevons are normally only in use at slow speeds, such as landing.[116] To avoid contact damage during takeoff and to provide a nose-down pitching attitude, all of the elevons remain drooped during takeoff until a high enough airspeed has been attained.[116] The B-2's low-observable, or \"stealth\", characteristics enable it to penetrate sophisticated anti-aircraft defenses undetected to attack heavily defended targets. This stealth comes from a combination of reduced acoustic, infrared, visual and radar signatures (multi-spectral camouflage), and permits the B-2 to operate with fewer supporting aircraft for air cover, and reduced Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses and electronic countermeasures. This makes the bomber a \"force multiplier\". As of September 2013[update], there have been no instances of a missile being launched at a B-2.[80] To reduce optical visibility during daylight flights, the B-2 is painted in an anti-reflective paint.[94] The undersides are dark because it flies at high altitudes (50,000 ft (15,000 m)), and at that altitude a dark grey painting blends well into the sky. It is speculated to have an upward-facing light sensor that alerts the pilot to increase or reduce altitude to match the changing illuminance of the sky.[117] The original design had tanks for a contrail-inhibiting chemical, but this was replaced in production aircraft by a contrail sensor that alerts the crew when they should change altitude.[118] The B-2 can be seen at ranges of 20 nmi (23 mi; 37 km) or less.[80] The B-2 is stored in a $5 million specialized air-conditioned hangar to maintain its stealth coating. Every seven years, this coating is carefully washed away with crystallized wheat starch so that the B-2's surfaces can be inspected for any dents or scratches.[119] The B-2's low-drag flying wing configuration provides exceptional range and reduces its radar profile.[78][120] Reportedly, the B-2 has a radar cross-section (RCS) of about 0.1 m2 (1.1 ft2).[121] The bomber does not always fly stealthily; when nearing air defenses pilots \"stealth up\" the B-2, a maneuver whose details are secret. The aircraft is stealthy, except briefly when the bomb bay opens. The flying wing design most closely resembles a so-called infinite flat plate (as vertical control surfaces dramatically increase RCS), the perfect stealth shape, as it would lack angles to reflect back radar waves (initially, the shape of the Northrop ATB concept was flatter; it gradually increased in volume according to specific military requirements).[122] Without vertical surfaces to reflect radar laterally, side aspect radar cross section is also reduced.[123] Radars operating at a lower frequency band (S or L band) are able to detect and track certain stealth aircraft that have multiple control surfaces, like canards or vertical stabilizers, where the frequency wavelength can exceed a certain threshold and cause a resonant effect.[124] RCS reduction as a result of shape had already been observed on the Royal Air Force's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber,[125] and the USAF's F-117 Nighthawk. The F-117 used flat surfaces (faceting technique) for controlling radar returns as during its development (see Lockheed Have Blue) in the early 1970s, technology only allowed for the simulation of radar reflections on simple, flat surfaces; computing advances in the 1980s made it possible to simulate radar returns on more complex curved surfaces.[126] The B-2 is composed of many curved and rounded surfaces across its exposed airframe to deflect radar beams. This technique, known as continuous curvature, was made possible by advances in computational fluid dynamics, and first tested on the Northrop Tacit Blue.[127][122] Some analysts claim infra-red search and track systems (IRSTs) can detect stealth aircraft, because any aircraft surface heats up due to air friction. A two-channel IRST is a CO2 (4.3 μm absorption maxima) detection possible, through comparing between the low and high channel.[128][129] Burying engines deep inside the fuselage minimizes the thermal visibility or infrared signature of the exhaust.[94][130] At the engine intake, cold air from the boundary layer below the main inlet enters the fuselage (boundary layer suction, first tested on the Northrop X-21) and is mixed with hot exhaust air just before the nozzles (similar to the Ryan AQM-91 Firefly). According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, this results in less energy (thermal radiation in the infrared spectrum) being released and thus a reduced heat signature. The resulting cooler air is conducted over a surface composed of heat resistant carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer and titanium alloy elements, which disperse the air laterally, to accelerate its cooling.[110] The B-2 lacks afterburners as the hot exhaust would increase the infrared signature; breaking the sound barrier would produce an obvious sonic boom as well as aerodynamic heating of the aircraft skin which would also increase the infrared signature. According to the Huygens–Fresnel principle, even a very flat plate would still reflect radar waves, though much less than when a signal is bouncing at a right angle. Additional reduction in its radar signature was achieved by the use of various radar-absorbent materials (RAM) to absorb and neutralize radar beams. The B-2 is mostly made of a carbon-graphite composite material that is stronger than steel, lighter than aluminum, and absorbs much radar energy.[82] The B-2 is assembled with unusually tight engineering tolerances to avoid leaks of fluids as they could increase its radar signature.[89] Innovations such as alternate high frequency material (AHFM) and automated material application methods were also used to improve the aircraft's radar-absorbent properties and reduce maintenance requirements.[94][131] In early 2004, Northrop Grumman began applying a new AHFM to operational B-2s.[132] To protect its radar-absorbent material and coatings, each B-2 is kept inside a climate-controlled hangar (Extra Large Deployable Aircraft Hangar System) large enough to accommodate its 172-foot (52 m) wingspan.[133] B-2s are supported by portable, environmentally-controlled hangars called B-2 Shelter Systems (B2SS).[134] The hangars are built by American Spaceframe Fabricators Incorporated and cost about US$5 million each.[134] The need for specialized hangars arose in 1998 when it was found that B-2s passing through Andersen Air Force Base did not have the climate-controlled environment maintenance operations required.[134] In 2003, the B2SS program was managed by the Combat Support System Program Office at Eglin Air Force Base.[134] B2SS hangars are known to have been deployed to Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia and Royal Air Force Fairford.[134] The first operational aircraft, christened Spirit of Missouri, was delivered to Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, where the fleet is based, on 17 December 1993.[135] The B-2 reached initial operational capability (IOC) on 1 January 1997.[136] Depot maintenance for the B-2 is accomplished by USAF contractor support and managed at Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center at Tinker Air Force Base.[10] Originally designed to deliver nuclear weapons, modern usage has shifted towards a flexible role with conventional and nuclear capability.[94] The B-2's combat debut was in 1999, during the Kosovo War. It was responsible for destroying 33% of selected Yugoslav bombing targets in the first eight weeks of U.S. involvement in the war.[10] During this war, six B-2s flew non-stop to Yugoslavia from their home base in Missouri and back, totaling 30 hours. Although the bombers accounted for 50 sorties out of a total of 34,000 NATO sorties, they dropped 11 percent of all bombs.[137] The B-2 was the first aircraft to deploy GPS satellite-guided JDAM \"smart bombs\" in combat use in Kosovo.[138] The use of JDAMs and precision-guided munitions effectively replaced the controversial tactic of carpet-bombing, which had been harshly criticized due to it causing indiscriminate civilian casualties in earlier conflicts, such as the 1991 Gulf War.[139] On 7 May 1999, a B-2 dropped five JDAMs on the Chinese Embassy[140] officially due to an error in targeting instructions, killing three people and injuring 20.[51] By then, the B-2 had dropped 500 bombs in Yugoslavia.[141] The B-2 bombed ground targets at the beginning of the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) (Operation Crescent Wind/Operation Enduring Freedom). With aerial refueling support, the B-2 flew one of its longest missions to date from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to Afghanistan and back.[10] B-2s would be stationed in the Middle East as a part of a US military buildup in the region from 2003.[142] The B-2's combat use preceded a USAF declaration of \"full operational capability\" in December 2003.[10] The Pentagon's Operational Test and Evaluation 2003 Annual Report noted that the B-2's serviceability for Fiscal Year 2003 was still inadequate, mainly due to the maintainability of the B-2's low observable coatings. The evaluation also noted that the Defensive Avionics suite had shortcomings with \"pop-up threats\".[10][143] During the Iraq War, B-2s operated from Diego Garcia and an undisclosed \"forward operating location\". Other sorties in Iraq have launched from Whiteman Air Force Base.[10] As of September 2013[update] the longest combat mission has been 44.3 hours.[80] \"Forward operating locations\" have been previously designated as Andersen Air Force Base in Guam and RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom, where new climate controlled hangars have been constructed. B-2s have conducted 27 sorties from Whiteman Air Force Base and 22 sorties from a forward operating location, releasing more than 1,500,000 pounds (680,000 kg) of munitions,[10] including 583 JDAM \"smart bombs\" in 2003.[98] In response to organizational issues and high-profile mistakes made within the USAF,[144][145] all of the B-2s, along with the nuclear-capable B-52s and the USAF's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), were transferred to the newly formed Air Force Global Strike Command on 1 February 2010.[146][147] In March 2011, B-2s were the first U.S. aircraft placed into action in Operation Odyssey Dawn, the UN mandated enforcement of the Libyan no-fly zone. Three B-2s dropped 40 bombs on a Libyan airfield in support of the UN no-fly zone.[148] The B-2s flew directly from the U.S. mainland across the Atlantic Ocean to Libya; each B-2 was refueled by allied tanker aircraft four times during each round trip mission.[149][150] In August 2011, The New Yorker reported that prior to the May 2011 U.S. Special Operations raid into Abbottabad, Pakistan that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden, U.S. officials had considered an airstrike by one or more B-2s as an alternative; the use of a bunker busting bomb was rejected due to potential damage to nearby civilian buildings.[151] There were also concerns an airstrike would make it difficult to positively identify bin Laden's remains, making it hard to confirm his death.[152] On 28 March 2013, two B-2s flew a round trip of 13,000 miles (21,000 km) from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to South Korea, dropping dummy ordnance on the Jik Do target range. The mission, part of the annual South Korean–U.S. military exercises, was the first time that B-2s flew over the Korean Peninsula. Tensions between the Koreas were high; North Korea protested the B-2's participation and threatened retaliatory nuclear strikes against South Korea and the United States.[153][154] On 18 January 2017, two B-2s attacked an ISIS training camp 19 miles (30 km) southwest of Sirte, Libya, killing about 85 militants. The B-2s together dropped 108 500-pound (230 kg) precision-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) bombs. These strikes were followed by an MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle firing Hellfire missiles. Each B-2 flew a 33-hour, round-trip mission from Whiteman Air Force Base with four or five (accounts differ) refuelings during the trip.[155][156] On 16 October 2024, B-2As struck five underground weapons storage facilities in Yemen as part of the campaign against the Houthis for attacking international shipping during the Red Sea crisis.[11] It was believed the strikes also served as a warning to Iran, demonstrating the stealth bomber's ability to destroy underground targets.[157][158] RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory, Australia, was used as a staging ground for the strikes.[159] On 22 June 2025, the U.S. carried out strikes in Iran. Six B-2As dropped 12 GBU-57 \"bunker buster\" bombs on the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant and a seventh dropped two more GBU-57s on the Natanz Nuclear Facility.[160][161][162] United States Air Force (19 aircraft in active inventory) On 23 February 2008, B-2 \"AV-12\" Spirit of Kansas crashed on the runway shortly after takeoff from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.[163] Spirit of Kansas had been operated by the 393rd Bomb Squadron, 509th Bomb Wing, Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, and had logged 5,176 flight hours. The two-person crew ejected safely from the aircraft. The aircraft was destroyed, a hull loss valued at US$1.4 billion.[164][165] After the accident, the USAF took the B-2 fleet off operational status for 53 days, returning on 15 April 2008.[166] The cause of the crash was later determined to be moisture in the aircraft's Port Transducer Units during air data calibration, which distorted the information being sent to the bomber's air data system. As a result, the flight control computers calculated an inaccurate airspeed, and a negative angle of attack, causing the aircraft to pitch upward 30 degrees during takeoff.[167] This was the first crash and loss of a B-2. In February 2010, a serious incident involving a B-2 occurred at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. The aircraft involved was AV-11 Spirit of Washington. The aircraft was severely damaged by fire while on the ground and underwent 18 months of repairs to enable it to fly back to the mainland U.S. for more comprehensive repairs.[168][169] Spirit of Washington was repaired and returned to service in December 2013.[170][171] At the time of the accident, the USAF had no training to deal with tailpipe fires on the B-2s.[172] On the night of 13–14 September 2021, B-2 Spirit of Georgia made an emergency landing at Whiteman Air Force Base. The aircraft landed and went off the runway into the grass and came to rest on its left side.[173] The cause was later determined to be faulty landing gear springs and \"microcracking\" in hydraulic connections on the aircraft. The lock link springs in the left landing gear had likely not been replaced in at least a decade, and produced about 11% less tension than specified. The \"microcracking\" reduced hydraulic support to the landing gear. These problems caused the landing gear to fold upon landing. The accident resulted in a minimum of $10.1 million in repair damages, but the final repair cost was still being determined in March 2022.[174][175] On 10 December 2022, an in-flight malfunction aboard B-2 AV-16 Spirit of Hawaii forced an emergency crash landing at Whiteman Air Force Base.[176] No personnel, including the flight crew, sustained injuries during the incident; there was a post-crash fire that was quickly put out.[177] Subsequently, all B-2s were grounded.[178] On 18 May 2023, Air Force officials lifted the grounding without disclosing any details about what caused the incident, or what steps had been taken to return the aircraft to operation.[179] In May 2024, the Air Force announced the B-2 would be divested, as it had been deemed to be \"uneconomical to repair.\" Although no cost estimate was provided, the decision was likely influenced by the coming introduction of the B-21 bomber; after the B-2 crash in 2010, it took almost four years and over $100 million to return the aircraft to service because not losing one of the few penetrating bombers in the inventory was considered necessary to justify the effort. However, the impending arrival of the B-21 and coming retirement of the B-2 sometime after 2029 likely made USAF leaders decide it would not be worth the expense to repair it, only for it to soon be retired.[12][180][failed verification] No operational B-2s have been retired by the Air Force to be put on display. B-2s have made occasional appearances on ground display at various air shows. B-2 test article (s/n AT-1000), the second of two built without engines or instruments and used for static testing, was placed on display in 2004 at the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio.[181] The test article passed all structural testing requirements before the airframe failed.[181] The museum's restoration team spent over a year reassembling the fractured airframe. The display airframe is marked to resemble Spirit of Ohio (S/N 82-1070), the B-2 used to test the design's ability to withstand extreme heat and cold.[181] The exhibit features Spirit of Ohio's nose wheel door, with its Fire and Ice artwork, which was painted and signed by the technicians who performed the temperature testing.[181] The restored test aircraft is on display in the museum's \"Cold War Gallery\".[182] Data from USAF Fact Sheet,[10] Pace,[183] Spick,[79] Northrop Grumman[B][184] General characteristics Performance Armament"}

It has been nicknamed the \"Bone\" (from \"B-One\").[2][3] As of 2024[update], it is one of the U.S. Air Force's three strategic bomber types, along with the B-2 Spirit and the B-52 Stratofortress. It carries up to a 75,000-pound (34,000 kg) payload.[4] The B-1 was first envisioned in the 1960s as a bomber that would combine the Mach 2 speed of the B-58 Hustler with the range and payload of the B-52, ultimately replacing both. After a long series of studies, North American Rockwell (subsequently renamed Rockwell International, B-1 division later acquired by Boeing) won the design contest for what emerged as the B-1A. Prototypes of this version could fly Mach 2.2 at high altitude and long distances and at Mach 0.85 at very low altitudes. The program was canceled in 1977 due to its high cost, the introduction of the AGM-86 cruise missile that flew the same basic speed and distance, and early work on the B-2 stealth bomber. The program was restarted in 1981, largely as an interim measure due to delays in the B-2 stealth bomber program. The B-1A design was altered, reducing top speed to Mach 1.25 at high altitude, increasing low-altitude speed to Mach 0.92, extensively improving electronic components, and upgrading the airframe to carry more fuel and weapons. Named the B-1B, deliveries of the new variant began in 1985; the plane formally entered service with Strategic Air Command (SAC) as a nuclear bomber the following year. By 1988, all 100 aircraft had been delivered. The B-1B was reassigned to Air Combat Command in 1992 and it was outfitted for conventional bombing, with its nuclear mission eliminated in 1994 per the START I treaty.[5] It first served in combat during the 1998 bombing of Iraq and again during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia the following year. The B-1B has supported U.S. and NATO military forces in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as strikes in Libya, Syria and Venezuela. As of 2025, the Air Force operates 45 B-1Bs bombers, with many retired units in the Boneyard.[6] The Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider is to begin replacing the B-1B after 2025; all B-1s are planned to be retired by 2036, replaced by the B-21.[7] In 1955, the USAF issued requirements for a new bomber combining the payload and range of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress with the Mach 2 maximum speed of the Convair B-58 Hustler.[8] In December 1957, the USAF selected North American Aviation's B-70 Valkyrie for this role, a six-engine bomber that could cruise at Mach 3 at high altitude (70,000 ft or 21,000 m).[9][10] Soviet Union interceptor aircraft, the only effective anti-bomber weapon in the 1950s,[11] were already unable to intercept the high-flying Lockheed U-2;[12] the Valkyrie would fly at similar altitudes, but much higher speeds, and was expected to fly right by the fighters.[11] By the late 1950s, however, anti-aircraft surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) could threaten high-altitude aircraft,[13] as demonstrated by the 1960 downing of Gary Powers' U-2.[14] The USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC) was aware of these developments and had begun moving its bombers to low-level penetration even before the U-2 incident. This tactic greatly reduces radar detection distances through the use of terrain masking; using features of the terrain like hills and valleys, the line-of-sight from the radar to the bomber can be broken, rendering the radar (and human observers) incapable of seeing it.[15] Additionally, radars of the era were subject to \"clutter\" from stray returns from the ground and other objects, which meant a minimum angle existed above the horizon where they could detect a target. Bombers flying at low altitudes could remain under these angles simply by keeping their distance from the radar sites. This combination of effects made SAMs of the era ineffective against low-flying aircraft.[15][16] The same effects also meant that low-flying aircraft were difficult to detect by higher-flying interceptors, since their radar systems could not readily pick out aircraft against the clutter from ground reflections (lack of look-down/shoot-down capability). The switch from high-altitude to low-altitude flight profiles severely affected the B-70, the design of which was tuned for high-altitude performance. Higher aerodynamic drag at low level limited the B-70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range.[13] The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed than the B-52, but less range. Because of this, and a growing shift to the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy,[11][17] and the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.[18] Although never intended for the low-level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast its intended successor as the nature of the air war environment changed. The B-52's huge fuel load allowed it to operate at lower altitudes for longer times, and the large airframe allowed the addition of improved radar jamming and deception suites to deal with radars.[19] During the Vietnam War, the concept that all future wars would be nuclear was turned on its head, and the \"big belly\" modifications increased the B-52's total bomb load to 60,000 pounds (27,000 kg),[20] turning it into a powerful tactical aircraft which could be used against ground troops along with strategic targets from high altitudes.[16] The much smaller bomb bay of the B-70 would have made it much less useful in this role. Although effective, the B-52 was not ideal for the low-level role. This led to a number of aircraft designs known as penetrators, which were tuned specifically for long-range low-altitude flight. The first of these designs to see operation was the supersonic F-111 fighter-bomber, which used variable-sweep wings for tactical missions.[21] A number of studies on a strategic-range counterpart followed. The first post-B-70 strategic penetrator study was known as the Subsonic Low-Altitude Bomber (SLAB), which was completed in 1961. This produced a design that looked more like an airliner than a bomber, with a large swept wing, T-tail, and large high-bypass engines.[22] This was followed by the similar Extended Range Strike Aircraft (ERSA), which added a variable-sweep wing, then en vogue in the aviation industry. ERSA envisioned a relatively small aircraft with a 10,000-pound (4,500 kg) payload and a range of 10,070 miles (16,210 km) including 2,900 miles (4,700 km) flown at low altitudes. In August 1963, the similar Low-Altitude Manned Penetrator design was completed, which called for an aircraft with a 20,000-pound (9,100 kg) bomb load and somewhat shorter range of 8,230 miles (13,240 km).[23][24] These all culminated in the October 1963 Advanced Manned Precision Strike System (AMPSS), which led to industry studies at Boeing, General Dynamics, and North American (later North American Rockwell).[25][26] In mid-1964, the USAF had revised its requirements and retitled the project as Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft (AMSA), which differed from AMPSS primarily in that it also demanded a high-speed high-altitude capability, similar to that of the existing Mach 2-class F-111.[27] Given the lengthy series of design studies, North American Rockwell engineers joked that the new name actually stood for \"America's Most Studied Aircraft\".[28] The arguments that led to the cancellation of the B-70 program had led some to question the need for a new strategic bomber of any sort. The USAF was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the nuclear triad concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe counterforce option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM made moot the mobility and survivability argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs, such as the Minuteman III, had the accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets. During this time, ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower unit cost,[29] but development costs were much higher.[13] Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the deterrent force[30] and felt a new expensive bomber was not needed.[31][32] McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964.[32] Program studies continued; IBM and Autonetics were awarded AMSA advanced avionics study contracts in 1968.[32][33] McNamara remained opposed to the program in favor of upgrading the existing B-52 fleet and adding nearly 300 FB-111s for shorter range roles then being filled by the B-58.[16][32] He again vetoed funding for AMSA aircraft development in 1968.[33] President Richard Nixon reestablished the AMSA program after taking office, keeping with his administration's flexible response strategy that required a broad range of options short of general nuclear war.[35] Nixon's Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, reviewed the programs and decided to lower the numbers of FB-111s, since they lacked the desired range, and recommended that the AMSA design studies be accelerated.[35] In April 1969, the program officially became the B-1A.[16][35] This was the first entry in the new bomber designation series, created in 1962. The Air Force issued a request for proposals in November 1969.[36] Proposals were submitted by Boeing, General Dynamics and North American Rockwell in January 1970.[36][37] In June 1970, North American Rockwell was awarded the development contract.[36] The original program called for two test airframes, five flyable aircraft, and 40 engines. This was cut in 1971 to one ground and three flight test aircraft.[38] The company changed its name to Rockwell International and named its aircraft division North American Aircraft Operations in 1973.[39] A fourth prototype, built to production standards, was ordered in the fiscal year 1976 budget. Plans called for 240 B-1As to be built, with initial operational capability set for 1979.[40] Rockwell's design had features common to the F-111 and XB-70. It used a crew escape capsule, that ejected as a unit to improve crew survivability if the crew had to abandon the aircraft at high speed. Additionally, the design featured large variable-sweep wings in order to provide both more lift during takeoff and landing, and lower drag during a high-speed dash phase.[41] With the wings set to their widest position the aircraft had a much better airfield performance than the B-52, allowing it to operate from a wider variety of bases. Penetration of the Soviet Union's defenses would take place at supersonic speed, crossing them as quickly as possible before entering the more sparsely defended interior of the country where speeds could be reduced again.[41] The large size and fuel capacity of the design would allow the \"dash\" portion of the flight to be relatively long. In order to achieve the required Mach 2 performance at high altitudes, the exhaust nozzles and air intake ramps were variable.[42] Initially, it had been expected that a Mach 1.2 performance could be achieved at low altitude, which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure. The low altitude performance requirement was later lowered to Mach 0.85, reducing the amount of titanium and therefore cost.[38] A pair of small vanes mounted near the nose are part of an active vibration damping system that smooths out the otherwise bumpy low-altitude ride.[43] The first three B-1As featured the escape capsule that ejected the cockpit with all four crew members inside. The fourth B-1A was equipped with a conventional ejection seat for each crew member.[44] The B-1A mockup review occurred in late October 1971; this resulted in 297 requests for alteration to the design due to failures to meet specifications and desired improvements for ease of maintenance and operation.[45] The first B-1A prototype (Air Force serial no. 74-0158) flew on 23 December 1974.[46] As the program continued the per-unit cost continued to rise in part because of high inflation during that period. In 1970, the estimated unit cost was $40 million, and by 1975, this figure had climbed to $70 million.[47] In 1976, Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko defected to Japan with his MiG-25 \"Foxbat\".[48] During debriefing he described a new \"super-Foxbat\" (almost certainly referring to the MiG-31) that had look-down/shoot-down radar in order to attack cruise missiles. This would also make any low-level penetration aircraft \"visible\" and easy to attack.[49] Given that the B-1's armament suite was similar to the B-52, and it then appeared no more likely to survive Soviet airspace than the B-52, the program was increasingly questioned.[50] In particular, Senator William Proxmire continually derided the B-1 in public, arguing it was an outlandishly expensive dinosaur. During the 1976 federal election campaign, Jimmy Carter made it one of the Democratic Party's platforms, saying \"The B-1 bomber is an example of a proposed system which should not be funded and would be wasteful of taxpayers' dollars.\"[51] When Carter took office in 1977 he ordered a review of the entire program. By this point the projected cost of the program had risen to over $100 million per aircraft, although this was lifetime cost over 20 years. He was informed of the relatively new work on stealth aircraft that had started in 1975, and he decided that this was a better approach than the B-1. Pentagon officials also stated that the AGM-86 Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) launched from the existing B-52 fleet would give the USAF equal capability of penetrating Soviet airspace. With a range of 1,500 miles (2,400 km), the ALCM could be launched well outside the range of any Soviet defenses and penetrate at low altitude like a bomber (with a much lower radar cross-section (RCS) due to smaller size), and in much greater numbers at a lower cost.[52] A small number of B-52s could launch hundreds of ALCMs, saturating the defense. A program to improve the B-52 and develop and deploy the ALCM would cost at least 20% less than the planned 244 B-1As.[51] On 30 June 1977, Carter announced that the B-1A would be canceled in favor of ICBMs, SLBMs, and a fleet of modernized B-52s armed with ALCMs.[40] Carter called it \"one of the most difficult decisions that I've made since I've been in office.\" No mention of the stealth work was made public with the program being top secret, but it is now known that in early 1978 he authorized the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) project, which eventually led to the B-2 Spirit.[53] Domestically, the reaction to the cancellation was split along partisan lines. The Department of Defense was surprised by the announcement; it expected that the number of B-1s ordered would be reduced to around 150.[54] Congressman Robert Dornan (R-CA) claimed, \"They're breaking out the vodka and caviar in Moscow.\"[55] However, it appears the Soviets were more concerned by large numbers of ALCMs representing a much greater threat than a smaller number of B-1s. Soviet news agency TASS commented that \"the implementation of these militaristic plans has seriously complicated efforts for the limitation of the strategic arms race.\"[51] Western military leaders were generally happy with the decision. NATO commander Alexander Haig described the ALCM as an \"attractive alternative\" to the B-1. French General Georges Buis stated \"The B-1 is a formidable weapon, but not terribly useful. For the price of one bomber, you can have 200 cruise missiles.\"[51] Flight tests of the four B-1A prototypes for the B-1A program continued through April 1981. The program included 70 flights totaling 378 hours. A top speed of Mach 2.22 was reached by the second B-1A. Engine testing also continued during this time with the YF101 engines totaling almost 7,600 hours.[56] It was during this period that the Soviets started to assert themselves in several new theaters of action, in particular through Cuban proxies during the Angolan Civil War starting in 1975 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on containing Communism and preparation for war in Europe. The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.[57] The U.S. Department of Defense responded by accelerating its Rapid Deployment Forces concept but suffered from major problems with airlift and sealift capability.[58] In order to slow an enemy invasion of other countries, air power was critical; however the key Iran-Afghanistan border was outside the range of the United States Navy's carrier-based attack aircraft, leaving this role to the U.S. Air Force. During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan campaigned heavily on the platform that Carter was weak on defense, citing the cancellation of the B-1 program as an example, a theme he continued using into the 1980s.[59] During this time Carter's defense secretary, Harold Brown, announced the stealth bomber project, apparently implying that this was the reason for the B-1 cancellation.[60][verification needed] On taking office, Reagan was faced with the same decision as Carter before: whether to continue with the B-1 for the short term, or to wait for the development of the ATB, a much more advanced aircraft. Studies suggested that the existing B-52 fleet with ALCM would remain a credible threat until 1985. It was predicted that 75% of the B-52 force would survive to attack its targets.[61] After 1985, the introduction of the SA-10 missile, the MiG-31 interceptor and the first effective Soviet Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) systems would make the B-52 increasingly vulnerable.[62] During 1981, funds were allocated to a new study for a bomber for the 1990s time-frame which led to developing the Long-Range Combat Aircraft (LRCA) project. The LRCA evaluated the B-1, F-111, and ATB as possible solutions; an emphasis was placed on multi-role capabilities, as opposed to purely strategic operations.[61] In 1981, it was believed the B-1 could be in operation before the ATB, covering the transitional period between the B-52's increasing vulnerability and the ATB's introduction. Reagan decided the best solution was to procure both the B-1 and ATB, and on 2 October 1981 he announced that 100 B-1s were to be ordered to fill the LRCA role.[41][63] In January 1982, the U.S. Air Force awarded two contracts to Rockwell worth a combined $2.2 billion for the development and production of 100 new B-1 bombers.[64] Numerous changes were made to the design to make it better suited to the now expected missions, resulting in the B-1B.[52] These changes included a reduction in maximum speed,[60] which allowed the variable-aspect intake ramps to be replaced by simpler fixed geometry intake ramps. This reduced the B-1B's radar cross-section which was seen as a good trade off for the speed decrease.[41] High subsonic speeds at low altitude became a focus area for the revised design,[60] and low-level speeds were increased from about Mach 0.85 to 0.92. The B-1B has a maximum speed of Mach 1.25 at higher altitudes.[41][65] The B-1B's maximum takeoff weight was increased to 477,000 pounds (216,000 kg) from the B-1A's 395,000 pounds (179,000 kg).[41][66] The weight increase was to allow for takeoff with a full internal fuel load and for external weapons to be carried. Rockwell engineers were able to reinforce critical areas and lighten non-critical areas of the airframe, so the increase in empty weight was minimal.[66] To deal with the introduction of the MiG-31 equipped with the new Zaslon radar system, and other aircraft with look-down capability, the B-1B's electronic warfare suite was significantly upgraded.[41] Opposition to the plan was widespread within Congress. Critics pointed out that many of the original problems remained in both areas of performance and expense.[67] In particular it seemed the B-52 fitted with electronics similar to the B-1B would be equally able to avoid interception, as the speed advantage of the B-1 was now minimal. It also appeared that the \"interim\" time frame served by the B-1B would be less than a decade, being rendered obsolete shortly after the introduction of a much more capable ATB design.[68] The primary argument in favor of the B-1 was its large conventional weapon payload, and that its takeoff performance allowed it to operate with a credible bomb load from a much wider variety of airfields. Production subcontracts were spread across many congressional districts, making the aircraft more popular on Capitol Hill.[69] B-1A No. 1 was disassembled and used for radar testing at the Rome Air Development Center in the former Griffiss Air Force Base, New York.[70] B-1As No. 2 and No. 4 were then modified to include B-1B systems. The first B-1B was completed and began flight testing in March 1983. The first production B-1B was rolled out on 4 September 1984 and first flew on 18 October 1984.[71] The 100th and final B-1B was delivered on 2 May 1988;[72] before the last B-1B was delivered, the USAF had determined that the aircraft was vulnerable to Soviet air defenses.[73] In 1996, Rockwell International sold most of its space and defense operations to Boeing,[74] which continues as the primary contractor for the B‑1 as of 2024.[1] The B-1 has a blended wing body configuration, with variable-sweep wings, four turbofan engines, triangular ride-control fins and a cruciform tail. The wings can sweep from 15 degrees to 67.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). Forward-swept wing settings are used for takeoff, landings and high-altitude economical cruise. Aft-swept wing settings are used in high subsonic and supersonic flight.[75] The B-1's variable-sweep wings and thrust-to-weight ratio provide it with improved takeoff performance, allowing it to use shorter runways than previous bombers.[76] The length of the aircraft presented a flexing problem due to air turbulence at low altitude. To alleviate this, Rockwell included small triangular fin control surfaces or vanes near the nose on the B-1. The B-1's Structural Mode Control System moves the vanes, and lower rudder, to counteract the effects of turbulence and smooth out the ride.[77] Unlike the B-1A, the B-1B cannot reach Mach 2+ speeds; its maximum speed is Mach 1.25 (about 825 mph or 1,325 km/h at altitude),[78] but its low-level speed increased to Mach 0.92 (700 mph, 1,130 km/h).[65] The speed of the current version of the aircraft is limited by the need to avoid damage to its structure and air intakes. To help lower its radar cross-section, the B-1B uses serpentine air intake ducts (see S-duct) and fixed intake ramps, which limit its speed compared to the B-1A. Vanes in the intake ducts serve to deflect and shield radar returns from the highly reflective engine compressor blades.[79] The B-1A's engine was modified slightly to produce the GE F101-102 for the B-1B, with an emphasis on durability, and increased efficiency.[80] The core from this engine was subsequently used in several other engines, including the GE F110 used in the F-14 Tomcat, F-15K/SG variants and later versions of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon.[81] It is also the basis for the non-afterburning GE F118 used in the B-2 Spirit and the U-2S.[81] The F101 engine core is also used in the CFM56 civil engine.[82] The nose-gear door is the location for ground-crew control of the auxiliary power unit (APU) which can be used during a scramble for quick-starting the APU.[83][84] The B-1's main computer is the IBM AP-101, which was also used on the Space Shuttle orbiter and the B-52 bomber.[85] The computer is programmed with the JOVIAL programming language.[86] The Lancer's offensive avionics include the Westinghouse (now Northrop Grumman) AN/APQ-164 forward-looking offensive passive electronically scanned array radar set with electronic beam steering (and a fixed antenna pointed downward for reduced radar observability), synthetic aperture radar, ground moving target indication (GMTI), and terrain-following radar modes, Doppler navigation, radar altimeter, and an inertial navigation suite.[87] The B-1B Block D upgrade added a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver beginning in 1995.[88] The B-1's defensive electronics include the Eaton AN/ALQ-161A radar warning and defensive jamming equipment,[89] which has three sets of antennas; one at the front base of each wing and the third rear-facing in the tail radome.[90][91] Also in the tail radome is the AN/ALQ-153 missile approach warning system (pulse-Doppler radar).[92] The ALQ-161 is linked to a total of eight AN/ALE-49 flare dispensers located on top behind the canopy, which are handled by the AN/ASQ-184 avionics management system.[93] Each AN/ALE-49 dispenser has a capacity of 12 MJU-23A/B flares. The MJU-23A/B flare is one of the world's largest infrared countermeasure flares at a weight of over 3.3 pounds (1.5 kg).[94] The B-1 has also been equipped to carry the ALE-50 towed decoy system.[95] Also aiding the B-1's survivability is its relatively low RCS. Although not technically a stealth aircraft, thanks to the aircraft's structure, serpentine intake paths and use of radar-absorbent material its RCS is about 1/50th that of the similar sized B-52. This is approximately 26 ft2 or 2.4 m2, comparable to that of a small fighter aircraft.[93][96][97] The B-1 holds 61 FAI world records for speed, payload, distance, and time-to-climb in different aircraft weight classes.[98][99] In November 1993, three B-1Bs set a long-distance record for the aircraft, which demonstrated its ability to conduct extended mission lengths to strike anywhere in the world and return to base without any stops.[100] The National Aeronautic Association recognized the B-1B for completing one of the 10 most memorable record flights for 1994.[95] The B-1 has been upgraded since production, beginning with the \"Conventional Mission Upgrade Program\" (CMUP), which added a new MIL-STD-1760 smart-weapons interface to enable the use of precision-guided conventional weapons. CMUP was delivered through a series of upgrades: In 2007, the Sniper XR targeting pod was integrated on the B-1 fleet. The pod is mounted on an external hardpoint at the aircraft's chin near the forward bomb bay.[107] Following accelerated testing, the Sniper pod was fielded in summer 2008.[108][109] Future precision munitions include the Small Diameter Bomb.[110] The USAF commenced the Integrated Battle Station (IBS) modification in 2012 as a combination of three separate upgrades when it realized the benefits of completing them concurrently; the Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL), Vertical Situational Display Unit (VSDU) and Central Integrated Test System (CITS).[111] FIDL enables electronic data sharing, eliminating the need to enter information between systems by hand.[112] VSDU replaces existing flight instruments with multifunction color displays, a second display aids with threat evasion and targeting, and acts as a back-up display. CITS saw a new diagnostic system installed that allows crew to monitor over 9,000 parameters on the aircraft.[113] Other additions are to replace the two spinning mass gyroscopic inertial navigation system with ring laser gyroscopic systems and a GPS antenna, replacement of the APQ-164 radar with the Scalable Agile Beam Radar – Global Strike (SABR-GS) active electronically scanned array, and a new attitude indicator.[114] The IBS upgrades were completed in 2020.[111] In August 2019, the Air Force unveiled a modification to the B-1B to allow it to carry more weapons internally and externally. Using the moveable forward bulkhead, space in the intermediate bay was increased from 180 to 269 in (457 to 683 cm). Expanding the internal bay to make use of the Common Strategic Rotary Launcher (CSRL), as well as utilizing six of the eight external hardpoints that had been previously out of use to keep in line with the New START Treaty, would increase the B-1B's weapon load from 24 to 40. The configuration also enables it to carry heavier weapons in the 5,000 lb (2,300 kg) range, such as hypersonic missiles; the AGM-183 ARRW is planned for integration onto the bomber. In the future the HAWC could be used by the bomber which, combining both internal and external weapon carriage, could conceivably bring the total number of hypersonic weapons to 31.[115][116][117] The second B-1B, \"The Star of Abilene\", was the first B-1B delivered to SAC in June 1985. Initial operational capability was reached on 1 October 1986 and the B-1B was placed on nuclear alert status.[118][119] The B-1 received the official name \"Lancer\" on 15 March 1990. However, the bomber has been commonly called the \"Bone\"; a nickname that appears to stem from an early newspaper article on the aircraft wherein its name was spelled out as \"B-ONE\" with the hyphen inadvertently omitted.[2] In late 1990, engine fires in two Lancers led to a grounding of the fleet. The cause was traced back to problems in the first-stage fan, and the aircraft were placed on \"limited alert\"; in other words, they were grounded unless a nuclear war broke out. Following inspections and repairs they were returned to duty beginning on 6 February 1991.[120][121] By 1991, the B-1 had a fledgling conventional capability, forty of them able to drop the 500-pound (230 kg) Mk-82 General Purpose (GP) bomb, although mostly from low altitude. Despite being cleared for this role, the problems with the engines prevented their use in Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War.[73][122] B-1s were primarily reserved for strategic nuclear strike missions at this time, providing the role of airborne nuclear deterrent against the Soviet Union.[122] The B-52 was more suited to the role of conventional warfare and it was used by coalition forces instead.[122] Originally designed strictly for nuclear war, the B-1's development as an effective conventional bomber was delayed. The collapse of the Soviet Union had brought the B-1's nuclear role into question, leading to President George H. W. Bush ordering a $3 billion conventional refit.[123] On 26 April 1991, ten B-1Bs narrowly avoided being hit by the 1991 Andover tornado while located at McConnell AFB, which took a direct hit. Two of the bombers were equipped with nuclear warheads.[124][125][126] After the inactivation of SAC and the establishment of the Air Combat Command (ACC) in 1992, the B-1 developed a greater conventional weapons capability. Part of this development was the start-up of the U.S. Air Force Weapons School B-1 Division.[127] In 1994, two additional B-1 bomb wings were also created in the Air National Guard, with former fighter wings in the Kansas Air National Guard and the Georgia Air National Guard converting to the aircraft.[128] By the mid-1990s, the B-1 could employ GP weapons as well as various CBUs. By the end of the 1990s, with the advent of the \"Block D\" upgrade, the B-1 boasted a full array of guided and unguided munitions. The B-1B no longer carries nuclear weapons;[41] its nuclear capability was disabled by 1995 with the removal of nuclear arming and fuzing hardware.[129] Under provisions of the New START treaty with Russia, further conversions were performed. These included modification of aircraft hardpoints to prevent nuclear weapon pylons from being attached, removal of weapons bay wiring bundles for arming nuclear weapons, and destruction of nuclear weapon pylons. The conversion process was completed in 2011, and Russian officials inspect the aircraft every year to verify compliance.[130] The B-1 was first used in combat in support of operations in Iraq during Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, employing unguided GP weapons. B-1s have been subsequently used in Operation Allied Force (Kosovo) and, most notably, in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[41] The B-1 has deployed an array of conventional weapons in war zones, most notably the GBU-31, 2,000-pound (910 kg) JDAM.[41] In the first six months of Operation Enduring Freedom, eight B-1s dropped almost 40 percent of aerial ordnance, including some 3,900 JDAMs.[114] JDAM munitions were heavily used by the B-1 over Iraq, notably on 7 April 2003 in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Saddam Hussein and his two sons.[131] During Operation Enduring Freedom, the B-1 was able to raise its mission capable rate to 79%.[95] Of the 100 B-1Bs built, 93 remained in 2000 after losses in accidents. In June 2001, the Pentagon sought to place one-third of its then fleet into storage; this proposal resulted in several U.S. Air National Guard officers and members of Congress lobbying against the proposal, including the drafting of an amendment to prevent such cuts.[73] The 2001 proposal was intended to allow money to be diverted to further upgrades to the remaining B-1Bs, such as computer modernization.[73] In 2003, accompanied by the removal of B-1Bs from the two bomb wings in the Air National Guard, the USAF decided to retire 33 aircraft to concentrate its budget on maintaining availability of remaining B-1Bs.[132] In 2004, a new appropriation bill called for some retired aircraft to return to service,[133] and the USAF returned seven mothballed bombers to service to increase the fleet to 67 aircraft.[134] On 14 July 2007, the Associated Press reported on the growing USAF presence in Iraq, including reintroduction of B-1Bs as a close-at-hand platform to support Coalition ground forces.[135] Beginning in 2008, B-1s were used in Iraq and Afghanistan in an \"armed overwatch\" role, loitering for surveillance purposes while ready to deliver guided bombs in support of ground troops as required.[136][137] The B-1B underwent a series of flight tests using a 50/50 mix of synthetic and petroleum fuel; on 19 March 2008, a B-1B from Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, became the first USAF aircraft to fly at supersonic speed using a synthetic fuel during a flight over Texas and New Mexico. This was conducted as part of an USAF testing and certification program to reduce reliance on traditional oil sources.[138] On 4 August 2008, a B-1B flew the first Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod equipped combat sortie where the crew successfully targeted enemy ground forces and dropped a GBU-38 guided bomb in Afghanistan.[108] In March 2011, B-1Bs from Ellsworth Air Force Base attacked undisclosed targets in Libya as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn.[139] With upgrades to keep the B-1 viable, the USAF may keep it in service until approximately 2038.[140] Despite upgrades, a single flight hour needs 48.4 hours of repair. The fuel, repairs, and other needs for a 12-hour mission cost $720,000 (~$1.01 million in 2024) as of 2010.[141] The $63,000 cost per flight hour is, however, less than the $72,000 for the B-52 and the $135,000 of the B-2.[142] In June 2010, senior USAF officials met to consider retiring the entire fleet to meet budget cuts.[143] The Pentagon plans to begin replacing the aircraft with the B-21 Raider after 2025.[144] In the meantime, its \"capabilities are particularly well-suited to the vast distances and unique challenges of the Pacific region, and we'll continue to invest in, and rely on, the B-1 in support of the focus on the Pacific\" as part of President Obama's \"Pivot to East Asia\".[145] In August 2012, the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron returned from a six-month tour in Afghanistan. Its 9 B-1Bs flew 770 sorties, the most of any B-1B squadron on a single deployment. The squadron spent 9,500 hours airborne, keeping one of its bombers in the air at all times. They accounted for a quarter of all combat aircraft sorties over the country during that time and fulfilled an average of two to three air support requests per day.[146] On 4 September 2013, a B-1B participated in a maritime evaluation exercise, deploying munitions such as laser-guided 500 lb GBU-54 bombs, 500 lb and 2,000 lb JDAM, and Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). The aim was to detect and engage several small craft using existing weapons and tactics developed from conventional warfare against ground targets; the B-1 is seen as a useful asset for maritime duties such as patrolling shipping lanes.[147] Beginning in 2014, the B-1 was used against the Islamic State (IS) in the Syrian Civil War.[148][149] From August 2014 to January 2015, the B-1 accounted for eight percent of USAF sorties during Operation Inherent Resolve.[150] The 9th Bomb Squadron was deployed to Qatar in July 2014 to support missions in Afghanistan, but when the air campaign against IS began on 8 August, the aircraft were employed in Iraq. During the Battle of Kobane in Syria, the squadron's B-1s dropped 660 bombs over 5 months in support of Kurdish forces defending the city. This amounted to one-third of all bombs used during OIR during the period, and they killed some 1,000 ISIL fighters. The 9th Bomb Squadron's B-1s went \"Winchester\"–dropping all weapons on board–31 times during their deployment. They dropped over 2,000 JDAMs during the six-month rotation.[149] B-1s from the 28th Bomb Wing flew 490 sorties where they dropped 3,800 munitions on 3,700 targets during a six-month deployment. In February 2016, the B-1s were sent back to the U.S. for cockpit upgrades.[151] As part of a USAF reorganization announced in April 2015, all B-1s were reassigned from Air Combat Command to Global Strike Command (GSC) in October 2015.[152] On 8 July 2017, the USAF flew two B-1s near the North Korean border in a show of force amid increasing tensions, particularly in response to North Korea's 4 July test of an ICBM capable of reaching Alaska.[153] On 14 April 2018, B-1s launched 19 JASSM missiles as part of the 2018 bombing of Damascus and Homs in Syria.[154][155][156] In August 2019, six B-1Bs met full mission capability; 15 were undergoing depot maintenance and 39 under repair and inspection.[157] In February 2021, the USAF announced it will retire 17 B-1s, leaving 45 aircraft in service. Four of these will be stored in a condition that will allow their return to service if required.[158][159] In March 2021, B-1s deployed to Norway's Ørland Main Air Station for the first time. During the deployment, they conducted bombing training with Norwegian and Swedish ground force Joint terminal attack controllers. One B-1 also conducted a warm-pit refuel at Bodø Main Air Station, marking the first landing inside Norway's Arctic Circle, and integrated with four Swedish Air Force JAS 39 Gripen fighters.[160][161] On 2 February 2024, the U.S. deployed two B-1Bs to strike 85 terrorist targets in seven locations in Iraq and Syria as part of a multi-tiered response to the killing of three U.S. troops in a drone attack in Jordan.[162] In January 2026, B-1Bs participated in the U.S. strikes in Venezuela, alongside F-35s, F-22s, F/A-18s, EA-18s and various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft and drones. The operation resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.[163] The USAF had 45 B-1Bs in service as of July 2024.[167] The Aviation Safety Network lists 15 accidents from 1984 to 2024 in which 11 B-1s were lost and a total of 12 crew members were killed.[179] An April 2022 maintenance fire damaged another.[180] Among the incidents: Data from USAF Fact Sheet,[95] Jenkins,[196] Pace,[65] Lee[89] General characteristics Performance Armament Avionics (single/dual load: 7,500 lb)[210] Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists"}

Studies began in 1954 and a UK–France treaty followed in 1962, as the programme cost was estimated at £70 million (£1.68 billion in 2023). Construction of six prototypes began in February 1965, with the first flight from Toulouse on 2 March 1969. The market forecast was 350 aircraft, with manufacturers receiving up to 100 options from major airlines. On 9 October 1975, it received its French certificate of airworthiness, and from the UK CAA on 5 December.[4] Concorde is an aircraft design with a narrow fuselage permitting four-abreast seating for 92 to 128 passengers, an ogival delta wing, and a droop nose for landing visibility. It is powered by four Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 turbojets with variable engine intake ramps, and reheat for take-off and acceleration to supersonic speed. Constructed from aluminium, it was the first airliner to have analogue fly-by-wire flight controls. The airliner had transatlantic range while supercruising at twice the speed of sound for 75% of the distance.[5] Delays and cost overruns pushed costs to £1.5–2.1 billion in 1976 (£11–16 billion in 2023). Concorde entered service on 21 January 1976 with Air France from Paris-Roissy and British Airways from London Heathrow. Transatlantic flights were the main market, to Washington Dulles from 24 May, and to New York JFK from 17 October 1977. Air France and British Airways remained the sole customers with seven airframes each, for a total production of 20. Supersonic flight more than halved travel times, but sonic booms over the ground limited it to transoceanic flights only. Its only competitor was the Tupolev Tu-144, carrying passengers from November 1977 until a May 1978 crash, while a potential competitor, the Boeing 2707, was cancelled in 1971 before any prototypes were built. On 25 July 2000, Air France Flight 4590 crashed shortly after take-off with all 109 occupants and four on the ground killed. This was the only fatal incident involving Concorde; commercial service was suspended until November 2001. The remaining aircraft were retired in 2003, 27 years after commercial operations had begun. Eighteen of the 20 aircraft built are preserved and are on display in Europe and North America. In the early 1950s, Arnold Hall, director of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), asked Morien Morgan to form a committee to study supersonic transport (SST). The group met in February 1954 and delivered their first report in April 1955.[6] Robert T. Jones' work at NACA had demonstrated that the drag at supersonic speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing.[7] This led to the use of short-span, thin, trapezoidal wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or aircraft such as the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter interceptor or the planned Avro 730 strategic bomber that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that resembled an enlarged Avro 730.[8] This short wingspan produced little lift at low speed, resulting in long take-off runs and high landing speeds.[9] In an SST design, this would have required enormous engine power to lift off from existing runways, and to provide the fuel needed, \"some horribly large aeroplanes\" resulted.[8] Based on this, the group considered the concept of an SST infeasible, and instead suggested continued low-level studies into supersonic aerodynamics.[8] Soon after, Johanna Weber and Dietrich Küchemann at the RAE published a series of reports on a new wing planform, known in the UK as the \"slender delta\".[10][11] The team, including Eric Maskell whose report \"Flow Separation in Three Dimensions\" contributed to an understanding of separated flow,[12] worked with the fact that delta wings can produce strong vortices on their upper surfaces at high angles of attack.[8] The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift. This had been noticed by Chuck Yeager in the Convair XF-92, but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Weber suggested that the effect could be used to improve low-speed performance.[11][8] Küchemann and Weber's papers changed the entire nature of supersonic design. The delta had already been used on aircraft, but these designs used planforms that were not much different from a swept wing of the same span. Weber noted that the lift from the vortex was increased by the length of the wing it had to operate over, which suggested that the effect would be maximised by extending the wing along the fuselage as far as possible. Such a layout would still have good supersonic performance, but also have reasonable take-off and landing speeds using vortex generation.[11] The aircraft would have to take off and land very \"nose high\" to generate the required vortex lift, which led to questions about the low-speed handling qualities of such a design.[13] Küchemann presented the idea at a meeting where Morgan was also present. Test pilot Eric Brown recalls Morgan's reaction to the presentation, saying that he immediately seized on it as the solution to the SST problem. Brown considers this moment as being the birth of the Concorde project.[13] On 1 October 1956, the Ministry of Supply asked Morgan to form a new study group, the Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee (STAC)[14] (sometimes referred to as the Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee), to develop a practical SST design and find industry partners to build it. At the first meeting, on 5 November 1956, the decision was made to fund the development of a test-bed aircraft to examine the low-speed performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the Handley Page HP.115.[13] This aircraft demonstrated safe control at speeds as low as 69 mph (111 km/h), about one-third that of the F-104 Starfighter.[15] Lift is not generated the same way at supersonic and subsonic speeds, with the lift-to-drag ratio for supersonic designs being about half that of subsonic designs.[16] The aircraft would need more thrust than a subsonic design of the same size. Although they would use more fuel in cruise, they would be able to fly more revenue-earning flights in a given time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs. STAC concluded that an SST would have economic performance similar to existing subsonic types.[8] STAC suggested that two designs naturally fell out of their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at Mach 1.2. Morgan suggested that a 150-passenger transatlantic SST would cost about £75 to £90 million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100-passenger short-range version would cost perhaps £50 to £80 million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962.[8] Morgan suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond, it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.[17] In 1959, a study contract was awarded to Hawker Siddeley and Bristol for preliminary designs based on the slender delta,[18] which developed as the HSA.1000 and Bristol 198. Armstrong Whitworth also responded with an internal design, the M-Wing, for the lower-speed, shorter-range category. Both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959, Hawker approached Lockheed, and after the creation of British Aircraft Corporation in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with Boeing, General Dynamics, Douglas Aircraft, and Sud Aviation.[18] Küchemann and others at the RAE continued their work on the slender delta throughout this period, considering three basic shapes - the classic straight-edge delta, the \"gothic delta\" that was rounded outward to appear like a gothic arch, and the \"ogival wing\" that was compound-rounded into the shape of an ogee. Each of these planforms had advantages and disadvantages. As they worked with these shapes, a practical concern grew to become so important that it forced selection of one of these designs.[19] Generally, the wing's centre of pressure (CP, or \"lift point\") should be close to the aircraft's centre of gravity (CG, or \"balance point\") to reduce the amount of control force required to pitch the aircraft. As the aircraft layout changes during the design phase, the CG commonly moves fore or aft. With a normal wing design, this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this. With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage, this was no longer easy; moving the wing would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail. Studying the various layouts in terms of CG changes, both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight, the ogee planform immediately came to the fore.[19] To test the new wing, NASA assisted the team by modifying a Douglas F5D Skylancer to mimic the wing selection. In 1965, the NASA test aircraft successfully tested the wing, and found that it reduced landing speeds noticeably over the standard delta wing. NASA also ran simulations at Ames that showed the aircraft would exhibit a sudden change in pitch when entering ground effect. Ames test pilots later participated in a joint cooperative test with the French and British test pilots and found that the simulations had been correct, and this information was added to pilot training.[20] France had its own SST plans. In the late 1950s, the government requested designs from the government-owned Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation, as well as Dassault. All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a ramjet-powered design flying at Mach 3, and the other two were jet-powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.[21] As soon as the design was complete, in April 1960, Pierre Satre, the company's technical director, was sent to Bristol to discuss a partnership. Bristol was surprised to find that the Sud team had designed a similar aircraft after considering the SST problem and coming to the same conclusions as the Bristol and STAC teams in terms of economics. It was later revealed that the original STAC report, marked \"For UK Eyes Only\", had secretly been passed to France to win political favour. Sud made minor changes to the paper and presented it as their own work.[22] France had no modern large jet engines and had already decided to buy a British design (as they had on the earlier subsonic Caravelle).[23] As neither company had experience in the use of heat-resistant metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used – above this speed, the friction with the air heats the metal so much that it begins to soften. This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Everyone involved agreed that Küchemann's ogee-shaped wing was the right one.[21] The British team was still focused on a 150-passenger design serving transatlantic routes, while France was deliberately avoiding these. Common components could be used in both designs, with the shorter-range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines, and the longer one a stretched fuselage and six engines, leaving only the wing to be extensively redesigned.[24] The teams continued to meet in 1961, and by this time it was clear that the two aircraft would be very similar in spite of different ranges and seating arrangements. A single design emerged that differed mainly in fuel load. More-powerful Bristol Siddeley Olympus engines, being developed for the TSR-2, allowed either design to be powered by only four engines.[25] While the development teams met, the French Minister of Public Works and Transport Robert Buron was meeting with the UK Minister of Aviation Peter Thorneycroft, and Thorneycroft told the cabinet that France was much more serious about a partnership than any of the US companies.[26] The various US companies had proved uninterested, likely due to the belief that the government would be funding development and would frown on any partnership with a European company, and the risk of \"giving away\" US technological leadership to a European partner.[18] When the STAC plans were presented to the UK cabinet, the economic considerations were considered highly questionable, especially as these were based on development costs, now estimated to be £150 million (US$420 million), which were repeatedly overrun in the industry. The Treasury Ministry presented a negative view, suggesting that the project in no way would have any positive financial returns for the government, especially because \"the industry's past record of over-optimistic estimating (including the recent history of the TSR.2) suggests that it would be prudent to consider\" the cost \"to turn out much too low.\"[26] This led to an independent review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on the topic between July and September 1962. The committee rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that any direct positive economic outcome would be unlikely, but that the project should still be considered because everyone else was going supersonic, and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets. The project apparently would not be likely to significantly affect other, more important, research efforts.[26] At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the European Economic Community, and this became the main rationale for moving ahead with the aircraft.[27] The development project was negotiated as an international treaty between the two countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies, and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK government, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation. This treaty was signed on 29 November 1962.[28] Charles de Gaulle vetoed the UK's entry into the European Community in a speech on 25 January 1963.[29] At Charles de Gaulle's January 1963 press conference, the aircraft was first called \"Concorde\".[30] The name was suggested by the 18-year-old son of F.G. Clark, the publicity manager at BAC's Filton plant.[30] Reflecting the treaty between the British and French governments that led to Concorde's construction, the name Concorde is from the French word concorde ( IPA: [kɔ̃kɔʁd]), which has an English equivalent, concord. Both words mean agreement, harmony, or union. The name was changed to Concord by Harold Macmillan in response to a perceived slight by de Gaulle. At the French roll-out in Toulouse in late 1967,[31] the British Minister of Technology, Tony Benn, announced that he would change the spelling back to Concorde.[32] This created a nationalist uproar that died down when Benn stated that the suffixed \"e\" represented \"Excellence, England, Europe, and Entente (Cordiale)\". In his memoirs, he recounted a letter from a Scotsman claiming, \"you talk about 'E' for England, but part of it is made in Scotland.\" Given Scotland's contribution of providing the nose cone for the aircraft, Benn replied, \"it was also 'E' for 'Écosse' (the French name for Scotland) – and I might have added 'e' for extravagance and 'e' for escalation as well!\"[33] In common usage in the United Kingdom, the type is known as \"Concorde\" without an article, rather than \"the Concorde\" or \"a Concorde\".[34][35] Advertisements for Concorde during the late 1960s placed in publications such as Aviation Week & Space Technology predicted a market for 350 aircraft by 1980.[36] The new consortium intended to produce one long-range and one short-range version, but prospective customers showed no interest in the short-range version, thus it was later dropped.[28] Concorde's costs spiralled during development to more than six times the original projections, arriving at a unit cost of £23 million in 1977 (equivalent to £180.49 million in 2023).[37] Its sonic boom made travelling supersonically over land impossible without causing complaints from citizens.[38] World events also dampened Concorde sales prospects; the 1973–74 stock market crash and the 1973 oil crisis had made airlines cautious about aircraft with high fuel consumption, and new wide-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 747, had recently made subsonic aircraft significantly more efficient and presented a low-risk option for airlines.[39] While carrying a full load, Concorde achieved 15.8 passenger miles per gallon of fuel, while the Boeing 707 reached 33.3 pm/g, the Boeing 747 46.4 pm/g, and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 53.6 pm/g.[40] A trend in favour of cheaper airline tickets also caused airlines such as Qantas to question Concorde's market suitability.[41] During the early 2000s, Flight International described Concorde as being \"one of aerospace's most ambitious but commercially flawed projects\",[42][43] The consortium received orders (non-binding options) for more than 100 of the long-range version from the major airlines of the day: Pan Am, BOAC, and Air France were the launch customers, with six aircraft each. Other airlines in the order book included Panair do Brasil, Continental Airlines, Japan Airlines, Lufthansa, American Airlines, United Airlines, Air India, Air Canada, Braniff, Singapore Airlines, Iran Air, Olympic Airways, Qantas, CAAC Airlines, Middle East Airlines, and TWA.[28][44][45] At the time of the first flight, the options list contained 74 options from 16 airlines:[46] The design work was supported by a research programme studying the flight characteristics of low ratio delta wings. A supersonic Fairey Delta 2 was modified to carry the ogee planform, and, renamed as the BAC 221, used for tests of the high-speed flight envelope;[50] the Handley Page HP.115 also provided valuable information on low-speed performance.[51] Construction of two prototypes began in February 1965: 001, built by Aérospatiale at Toulouse, and 002, by BAC at Filton, Bristol. 001 made its first test flight from Toulouse on 2 March 1969, piloted by André Turcat,[52] and first went supersonic on 1 October.[53][54] The first UK-built Concorde flew from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, piloted by Brian Trubshaw.[55][56] Both prototypes were presented to the public on 7–8 June 1969 at the Paris Air Show. As the flight programme progressed, 001 embarked on a sales and demonstration tour on 4 September 1971, which was also the first transatlantic crossing of Concorde.[57][58] Concorde 002 followed on 2 June 1972 with a tour of the Middle and Far East.[59] Concorde 002 made the first visit to the United States in 1973, landing at Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport to mark the airport's opening.[60] Concorde had initially held a great deal of customer interest, but the project was hit by order cancellations. The Paris Le Bourget air show crash of the competing Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 had shocked potential buyers, and public concern over the environmental issues of supersonic aircraft – the sonic boom, take-off noise and pollution – had produced a change in the public opinion of SSTs. By 1976 the remaining buyers were from four countries: Britain, France, China, and Iran.[38] Only Air France and British Airways (the successor to BOAC) took up their orders, with the two governments taking a cut of any profits.[61] The US government cut federal funding for the Boeing 2707, its supersonic transport programme, in 1971; Boeing did not complete its two 2707 prototypes. The US, India, and Malaysia all ruled out Concorde supersonic flights over the noise concern, although some of these restrictions were later relaxed.[62][63] Professor Douglas Ross characterised restrictions placed upon Concorde operations by President Jimmy Carter's administration as having been an act of protectionism of American aircraft manufacturers.[64] The original programme cost estimate was £70 million in 1962,[65] (£1.68 billion in 2023).[66] After cost overruns and delays the programme eventually cost between £1.5 and £2.1 billion in 1976,[67] (£11.4 billion – 16 billion in 2023).[66] This cost was the main reason the production run was much smaller than expected.[68] Concorde is an ogival delta winged aircraft with four Olympus engines based on those employed in the RAF's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber. It has an unusual tailless configuration for a commercial aircraft, as does the Tupolev Tu-144. Concorde was the first airliner to have a fly-by-wire flight-control system (in this case, analogue); the avionics system Concorde used was unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ hybrid circuits.[69] The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy.[70] Concorde pioneered the following technologies: For high speed and optimisation of flight: For weight-saving and enhanced performance: A symposium titled \"Supersonic-Transport Implications\" was hosted by the Royal Aeronautical Society on 8 December 1960. Various views were put forward on the likely type of powerplant for a supersonic transport, such as podded or buried installation and turbojet or ducted-fan engines.[83][84] Concorde needed to fly long distances to be economically viable; this required high efficiency from the powerplant. Turbofan engines were rejected due to their larger cross-section producing excessive drag (but would be studied for future SSTs). Olympus turbojet technology was already available for development to meet the design requirements.[85] Rolls-Royce proposed developing the RB.169 to power Concorde during its initial design phase,[86] but developing a wholly-new engine for a single aircraft would have been extremely costly,[87] so the existing BSEL Olympus Mk 320 turbojet engine, which was already flying in the BAC TSR-2 supersonic strike bomber prototype, was chosen instead.[25] Boundary layer management in the podded installation was put forward as simpler with only an inlet cone, however, Dr. Seddon of the RAE favoured a more integrated buried installation. One concern of placing two or more engines behind a single intake was that an intake failure could lead to a double or triple engine failure. While a ducted fan over the turbojet would reduce noise, its larger cross-section also incurred more drag.[88] Acoustics specialists were confident that a turbojet's noise could be reduced and SNECMA made advances in silencer design during the programme.[89] The Olympus Mk.622 with reduced jet velocity was proposed to reduce the noise[90] but was not pursued. By 1974, the spade silencers which projected into the exhaust were reported to be ineffective but \"entry-into-service aircraft are likely to meet their noise guarantees\".[91] The powerplant configuration selected for Concorde highlighted airfield noise, boundary layer management and interactions between adjacent engines and the requirement that the powerplant, at Mach 2, tolerate pushovers, sideslips, pull-ups and throttle slamming without surging.[92] Extensive development testing with design changes and changes to intake and engine control laws addressed most of the issues except airfield noise and the interaction between adjacent powerplants at speeds above Mach 1.6 which meant Concorde \"had to be certified aerodynamically as a twin-engined aircraft above Mach 1.6\".[93] Situated behind the wing leading edge, the engine intake had a wing boundary layer ahead of it. Two-thirds were diverted and the remaining third which entered the intake did not adversely affect the intake efficiency[94] except during pushovers when the boundary layer thickened and caused surging. Wind tunnel testing helped define leading-edge modifications ahead of the intakes which solved the problem.[95] Each engine had its own intake and the nacelles were paired with a splitter plate between them to minimise the chance of one powerplant influencing the other. Only above Mach 1.6 (1,960 km/h; 1,220 mph) was an engine surge likely to affect the adjacent engine.[93] The air intake design for Concorde's engines was especially critical.[96] The intakes had to slow down supersonic inlet air to subsonic speeds with high-pressure recovery to ensure efficient operation at cruising speed while providing low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and maintaining high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternative path for excess intake of air during engine throttling or shutdowns.[97] The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, a dump door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.[98] As well as supplying air to the engine, the intake also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the propelling nozzle. The nozzle ejector (or aerodynamic) design, with variable exit area and secondary flow from the intake, contributed to good expansion efficiency from take-off to cruise.[99] Concorde's Air Intake Control Units (AICUs) made use of a digital processor for intake control. It was the first use of a digital processor with full authority control of an essential system in a passenger aircraft. It was developed by BAC's Electronics and Space Systems division after the analogue AICUs (developed by Ultra Electronics) fitted to the prototype aircraft were found to lack sufficient accuracy.[100] Ultra Electronics also developed Concorde's thrust-by-wire engine control system.[101] Engine failure causes problems on conventional subsonic aircraft; not only does the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank in the direction of the failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without difficulties.[102] During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero. So, on Concorde, engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double-engine failure.[103] Concorde used reheat (afterburners) only at take-off and to pass through the transonic speed range, between Mach 0.95 and 1.7.[104] Kinetic heating from the high speed boundary layer caused the skin to heat up during supersonic flight.[105] Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch by the end of the flight.[106] Apart from the engine bay, the hottest part of any supersonic aircraft's structure is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, was used throughout the aircraft because it was relatively cheap and easy to work with. The highest temperature it could sustain over the life of the aircraft was 127 °C (261 °F), which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02.[107] Concorde went through two cycles of cooling and heating during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude at subsonic speed, then heating up accelerating to cruise speed, finally cooling again when descending and slowing down before heating again in low altitude air before landing. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing.[108][109] The airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.[110] As the fuselage heated up it expanded by as much as 300 mm (12 in). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when the airframe shrank again.[111] To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning.[112] The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight a visor was used to keep high temperature air from flowing over the cockpit skin.[113] Concorde had livery restrictions; the majority of the surface had to be covered with a highly reflective white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by 6 to 11 °C (11 to 20 °F).[114] Due to its high speeds, large forces were applied to the aircraft during turns, causing distortion of the aircraft's structure. There were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevon deflections, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, attached to the stiffest area of the wings, were used at higher speeds.[115] The narrow fuselage flexed,[71] which was apparent to rear passengers looking along the length of the cabin.[116] When any aircraft passes the critical mach of its airframe, the centre of pressure shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch-down moment on the aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was. The wings were designed to reduce this, but there was still a shift of about 2 metres (6 ft 7 in). This could have been countered by the use of trim controls, but at such high speeds, this would have increased drag which would have been unacceptable. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.[117] To fly non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean, Concorde required the greatest supersonic range of any aircraft.[118] This was achieved by a combination of powerplants which were efficient at twice the speed of sound, a slender fuselage with high fineness ratio, and a complex wing shape for a high lift-to-drag ratio. Only a modest payload could be carried and the aircraft was trimmed without using deflected control surfaces, to avoid the drag that would incur.[10][117] Nevertheless, soon after Concorde began flying, a Concorde \"B\" model was designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with leading edge slats to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds, with the objective of expanding the range to reach markets in new regions.[119] It would have higher thrust engines with noise reducing features and no environmentally objectionable afterburner. Preliminary design studies showed that an engine with a 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 could be produced.[120] This would have given 500 mi (805 km) additional range and a greater payload, making new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.[121] Concorde's high cruising altitude meant people on board received almost twice the flux of extraterrestrial ionising radiation as those travelling on a conventional long-haul flight.[122][123] Upon Concorde's introduction, it was speculated that this exposure during supersonic travels would increase the likelihood of skin cancer.[124] Due to the proportionally reduced flight time, the overall equivalent dose would normally be less than a conventional flight over the same distance.[125] Unusual solar activity might lead to an increase in incident radiation.[126] To prevent incidents of excessive radiation exposure, the flight deck had a radiometer and an instrument to measure the rate of increase or decrease of radiation. If the radiation level became too high, Concorde would descend below 47,000 feet (14,000 m).[123] Airliner cabins were usually maintained at a pressure equivalent to 6,000–8,000 feet (1,800–2,400 m) elevation. Concorde's pressurisation was set to an altitude at the lower end of this range, 6,000 feet (1,800 m).[127] Concorde's maximum cruising altitude was 60,000 feet (18,000 m); subsonic airliners typically cruise below 44,000 feet (13,000 m).[128] A sudden reduction in cabin pressure is hazardous to all passengers and crew.[129] Above 50,000 feet (15,000 m), a sudden cabin depressurisation would leave a \"time of useful consciousness\" up to 10–15 seconds for a conditioned athlete.[130] At Concorde's altitude, the air density is very low; a breach of cabin integrity would result in a loss of pressure severe enough that the plastic emergency oxygen masks installed on other passenger jets would not be effective and passengers would soon suffer from hypoxia despite quickly donning them. Concorde was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss in the event of a breach,[131] a reserve air supply system to augment cabin air pressure, and a rapid descent procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude. The FAA enforces minimum emergency descent rates for aircraft and noting Concorde's higher operating altitude, concluded that the best response to pressure loss would be a rapid descent.[132] Continuous positive airway pressure would have delivered pressurised oxygen directly to the pilots through masks.[131] While subsonic commercial jets took eight hours to fly from Paris to New York (seven hours from New York to Paris), the average supersonic flight time on the transatlantic routes was just under 3.5 hours. Concorde had a maximum cruising altitude of 18,300 metres (60,000 ft) and an average cruise speed of Mach 2.02 (2,150 km/h; 1,330 mph), more than twice the speed of conventional aircraft.[128] With no other civil traffic operating at its cruising altitude of about 56,000 ft (17,000 m), Concorde had exclusive use of dedicated oceanic airways, or \"tracks\", separate from the North Atlantic Tracks, the routes used by other aircraft to cross the Atlantic. Due to the significantly less variable nature of high altitude winds compared to those at standard cruising altitudes, these dedicated SST tracks had fixed co-ordinates, unlike the standard routes at lower altitudes, whose co-ordinates are replotted twice daily based on forecast weather patterns (jetstreams).[133] Concorde would also be cleared in a 15,000-foot (4,570 m) block, allowing for a slow climb from 45,000 to 60,000 ft (14,000 to 18,000 m) during the oceanic crossing as the fuel load gradually decreased.[134] In regular service, Concorde employed an efficient cruise-climb flight profile following take-off.[135] The delta-shaped wings required Concorde to adopt a higher angle of attack at low speeds than conventional aircraft, but it allowed the formation of large low-pressure vortices over the entire upper wing surface, maintaining lift.[136] The normal landing speed was 170 miles per hour (274 km/h).[137] Because of this high angle, during a landing approach Concorde was on the backside of the drag force curve, where raising the nose would increase the rate of descent; the aircraft was thus largely flown on the throttle and was fitted with an autothrottle to reduce the pilot's workload.[138] The only thing that tells you that you're moving is that occasionally when you're flying over the subsonic aeroplanes you can see all these 747s 20,000 feet below you almost appearing to go backwards, I mean you are going 800 miles an hour or thereabouts faster than they are. The aeroplane was an absolute delight to fly, it handled beautifully. And remember we are talking about an aeroplane that was being designed in the late 1950s – mid-1960s. I think it's absolutely amazing and here we are, now in the 21st century, and it remains unique. — John Hutchinson, Concorde Captain, \"The World's Greatest Airliner\" (2003)[139] Because of the way Concorde's delta-wing generated lift, the undercarriage had to be unusually strong and tall to allow for the angle of attack at low speed. At rotation, Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation, the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation (199 knots or 369 kilometres per hour or 229 miles per hour indicated airspeed), this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage in a way that was initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign.[140] Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels was added aft to prevent tailstrikes. The main undercarriage units swing towards each other to be stowed but due to their great height also needed to contract in length telescopically before swinging to clear each other when stowed.[141] The four main wheel tyres on each bogie unit are inflated to 232 psi (1,600 kPa). The twin-wheel nose undercarriage retracts forwards and its tyres are inflated to a pressure of 191 psi (1,320 kPa), and the wheel assembly carries a spray deflector to prevent standing water from being thrown up into the engine intakes. The tyres are rated to a maximum speed on the runway of 250 mph (400 km/h).[142] The high take-off speed of 250 miles per hour (400 km/h) required Concorde to have upgraded brakes. Like most airliners, Concorde has anti-skid braking to prevent the tyres from losing traction when the brakes are applied. The brakes, developed by Dunlop, were the first carbon-based brakes used on an airliner.[143] The use of carbon over equivalent steel brakes provided a weight-saving of 1,200 lb (540 kg).[144] Each wheel has multiple discs which are cooled by electric fans. Wheel sensors include brake overload, brake temperature, and tyre deflation. After a typical landing at Heathrow, brake temperatures were around 300–400 °C (570–750 °F). Landing Concorde required a minimum of 6,000 feet (1,800 m) runway length; the shortest runway Concorde ever landed on carrying commercial passengers was Cardiff Airport.[145] Concorde G-AXDN (101) made its final landing at Duxford Aerodrome on 20 August 1977, which had a runway length of just 6,000 feet (1,800 m) at the time.[146][147] This was the last aircraft to land at Duxford before the runway was shortened later that year.[148] Concorde's drooping nose, developed by Marshall's of Cambridge,[149] enabled the aircraft to switch from being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency during flight, to not obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due to the high angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the ability to droop. The droop nose was accompanied by a moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.[149] A controller in the cockpit allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and take-off. Following take-off and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximal visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage due to collision with ground vehicles, and then raised fully before engine shutdown to prevent pooling of internal condensation within the radome seeping down into the aircraft's pitot/ADC system probes.[149] The US Federal Aviation Administration had objected to the restrictive visibility of the visor used on the first two prototype Concordes, which had been designed before a suitable high-temperature window glass had become available, and thus requiring alteration before the FAA would permit Concorde to serve US airports. This led to the redesigned visor used in the production and the four pre-production aircraft (101, 102, 201, and 202).[150] The nose window and visor glass, needed to endure temperatures in excess of 100 °C (210 °F) at supersonic flight, were developed by Triplex.[151] Concorde began scheduled flights with British Airways and Air France on 21 January 1976.[152] Concorde operated on various routes, including London–Bahrain, London–New York, London–Miami, and London–Barbados (with British Airways), and Paris–Dakar–Rio de Janeiro, Paris–Azores–Caracas, Paris–New York, and Paris–Washington (with Air France), but faced challenges such as bans and low profitability. Later, British Airways repositioned Concorde as a super-premium service and it then became profitable.[153] In 2003, Air France and British Airways announced the retirement of Concorde, due to rising maintenance costs, low passenger numbers following the 25 July 2000 crash, and the slump in air travel following the September 11 attacks.[154] Air France flew its last commercial flight on 30 May 2003[155][156] with British Airways retiring its Concorde fleet on 24 October 2003.[3] On 25 July 2000, Air France Flight 4590, registration F-BTSC, crashed in Gonesse, France, after departing from Charles de Gaulle Airport en route to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, killing all 100 passengers and nine crew members on board as well as four people on the ground. It was the only fatal accident involving Concorde. This crash also damaged Concorde's reputation and caused both British Airways and Air France to temporarily ground their fleets.[159] According to the official investigation conducted by the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA), the crash was caused by a metallic strip that had fallen from a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off minutes earlier. This fragment punctured a tyre on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a sudden descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the Hôtelissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.[160] Before the accident, Concorde had been arguably the safest operational passenger airliner in the world with zero passenger deaths, but there had been two prior non-fatal accidents and a rate of tyre damage 30 times higher than subsonic airliners from 1995 to 2000.[161][162][163][164] Safety improvements made after the crash included more secure electrical controls, Kevlar lining on the fuel tanks and specially developed burst-resistant tyres.[165] The first flight with the modifications departed from London Heathrow on 17 July 2001, piloted by BA Chief Concorde Pilot Mike Bannister. In a flight of 3 hours 20 minutes over the mid-Atlantic towards Iceland, Bannister attained Mach 2.02 and 60,000 ft (18,000 m) then returned to RAF Brize Norton. The test flight, intended to resemble the London–New York route, was declared a success and was watched on live TV, and by crowds on the ground at both locations.[166] The first flight with passengers after the 2000 grounding landed shortly before the World Trade Center attacks in the United States. This was not a commercial flight; all the passengers were BA employees.[159] Normal commercial operations resumed on 7 November 2001 by BA and AF (aircraft G-BOAE and F-BTSD), with service to New York JFK, where Mayor Rudy Giuliani greeted the passengers.[167][168] Official investigating authorities have classified occurrences prior to Air France Flight 4590 as accidents, though no persons were injured and no aircraft were lost. These involved occurrences in which parts of the rudder had become separated inflight. On 12 April 1989, Concorde G-BOAF, on a chartered flight from Christchurch, New Zealand, to Sydney, Australia, suffered a structural failure at supersonic speed. As the aircraft was climbing and accelerating through Mach 1.7, a \"thud\" was heard. The crew did not notice any handling problems, and they assumed the thud they heard was a minor engine surge. No further difficulty was encountered until descent through 40,000 feet (12,000 m) at Mach 1.3, when a vibration was felt throughout the aircraft, lasting two to three minutes. Most of the upper rudder had separated from the aircraft at this point. Aircraft handling was unaffected, and the aircraft made a safe landing at Sydney. The UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) concluded that the skin of the rudder had been separating from the rudder structure over a period before the accident due to moisture seepage past the rivets in the rudder. Production staff had not followed proper procedures during an earlier modification of the rudder; the procedures were difficult to adhere to.[161] The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.[161] On 21 March 1992, G-BOAB while flying British Airways Flight 001 from London to New York, also suffered a structural failure at supersonic speed. While cruising at Mach 2, at approximately 53,000 feet (16,000 m), the crew heard a \"thump\". No difficulties in handling were noticed, and no instruments gave any irregular indications. This crew also suspected there had been a minor engine surge. One hour later, during descent and while decelerating below Mach 1.4, a sudden \"severe\" vibration began throughout the aircraft.[162] The vibration worsened when power was added to the No 2 engine. The crew shut down the No 2 engine and made a successful landing in New York, noting that increased rudder control was needed to keep the aircraft on its intended approach course. Again, the skin had separated from the structure of the rudder, which led to most of the upper rudder detaching in flight. The AAIB concluded that repair materials had leaked into the structure of the rudder during a recent repair, weakening the bond between the skin and the structure of the rudder, leading to it breaking up in flight. The large size of the repair had made it difficult to keep repair materials out of the structure, and prior to this accident, the severity of the effect of these repair materials on the structure and skin of the rudder was not appreciated.[162] Four incidents of partial rudder separation similar to the above accidents occurred in 1991, 1998, 2002, and 2003.[169][170][171] Three incidents involving separation of part of an elevon (control surface on the trailing edge of Concorde's delta wing) have also occurred inflight.[172] Although similar to the occurrences described above under Accidents, available official reports do not describe these as accidents. Degradation in aircraft performance or flight characteristics can be the basis for designation as an accident,[173] and the pilots involved in these incidents did not report such degradations. Tyre failures were an ongoing problem for Concorde.[174] While investigating the crash of Flight 4590, the BEA established that from 1976 until the crash of Flight 4590 there had been 57 incidents of tyre failure involving Concordes. The most serious of these occurred on 14 June 1979, when Concorde F-BVFC lost two tyres during its takeoff roll at Washington Dulles Airport. Tyre #6 deflated and fragmented, and tyre #5 burst. Debris flying off at high speed from the tyres and damaged landing gear struck several locations under the wing, causing damage to electric and hydraulic lines and penetrating three fuel tanks. An opening of about 0.5 square metres was torn through the upper surface of the wing. One hydraulic system was lost completely and another was degraded. When the aircraft landed, it was leaking 4 kilograms (5 litres) of fuel per second.[175][164] One month later, Concorde F-BFVD, a scheduled flight from Washington Dulles to Paris, suffered a tyre failure on takeoff from the same airport. Fragments from the tyre were ingested into the number two engine, causing its complete failure when the flight reached 29,000 feet in altitude.[176] The flight diverted to JFK airport in New York.[174] Twenty Concorde aircraft were built: two prototypes, two pre-production aircraft, two development aircraft and 14 production aircraft for commercial service. With the exception of two of the production aircraft, all are preserved, mostly in museums. One aircraft was scrapped in 1994, and another was destroyed in the Air France Flight 4590 crash in 2000. Concorde was one of only two supersonic jetliner models to operate commercially; the other was the Soviet-built Tupolev Tu-144, which operated in the late 1970s.[177][178] The Tu-144 was nicknamed \"Concordski\" by Western European journalists for its outward similarity to Concorde.[179] Soviet espionage efforts allegedly stole Concorde blueprints to assist in the design of the Tu-144.[180][page needed] As a result of a rushed development programme, the first Tu-144 prototype was substantially different from the preproduction machines, but both were cruder than Concorde. The Tu-144S had a significantly shorter range than Concorde. Jean Rech, Sud Aviation, attributed this to two things,[181] a very heavy powerplant with an intake twice as long as that on Concorde, and low-bypass turbofan engines with too high a bypass ratio which needed afterburning for cruise. The aircraft had poor control at low speeds because of a simpler wing design. The Tu-144 required braking parachutes to land.[182] The Tu-144 had two crashes, one at the 1973 Paris Air Show,[183][184] and another during a pre-delivery test flight in May 1978.[185][186] Passenger service commenced in November 1977, but after the 1978 crash the aircraft was taken out of passenger service after only 55 flights, which carried an average of 58 passengers. The Tu-144 had an inherently unsafe structural design as a consequence of an automated production method chosen to simplify and speed up manufacturing.[187] The Tu-144 program was cancelled by the Soviet government on 1 July 1983.[188] The main competing designs for the US government-funded supersonic transport (SST) were the swing-wing Boeing 2707 and the compound delta wing Lockheed L-2000. These were to have been larger, with seating for up to 300 people.[189][190] The Boeing 2707 was selected for development. Concorde first flew in 1969, the year Boeing began building 2707 mockups after changing the design to a cropped delta wing; the cost of this and other changes helped to kill the project.[191] The operation of US military aircraft such as the Mach 3+ North American XB-70 Valkyrie prototypes and Convair B-58 Hustler strategic nuclear bomber had shown that sonic booms were capable of reaching the ground,[192] and the experience from the Oklahoma City sonic boom tests led to the same environmental concerns that hindered the commercial success of Concorde. The American government cancelled its SST project in 1971 having spent more than $1 billion without any aircraft being built.[193] Before Concorde's flight trials, developments in the civil aviation industry were largely accepted by governments and their respective electorates. Opposition to Concorde's noise, particularly on the east coast of the United States,[194][195] forged a new political agenda on both sides of the Atlantic, with scientists and technology experts across a multitude of industries beginning to take the environmental and social impact more seriously.[196][197] Although Concorde led directly to the introduction of a general noise abatement programme for aircraft flying out of John F. Kennedy Airport, many found that Concorde was quieter than expected,[71] partly due to the pilots temporarily throttling back their engines to reduce noise during overflight of residential areas.[198] Even before commercial flights started, it had been claimed that Concorde was quieter than many other aircraft.[199] In 1971, BAC's technical director stated, \"It is certain on present evidence and calculations that in the airport context, production Concordes will be no worse than aircraft now in service and will in fact be better than many of them.\"[200] Concorde produced nitrogen oxides in its exhaust, which, despite complicated interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood to result in degradation to the ozone layer at the stratospheric altitudes it cruised.[201] It has been pointed out that other, lower-flying, airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted. The small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible.[201] In 1995, David Fahey, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States, warned that a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft with exhausts similar to Concorde might produce a 2 per cent drop in global ozone levels, much higher than previously thought. Each 1 per cent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 per cent. Dr Fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised sulphur in the fuel, as he believed, then removing sulphur in the fuel will reduce the ozone-destroying impact of supersonic transport.[202] Concorde's technical leap forward boosted the public's understanding of conflicts between technology and the environment as well as awareness of the complex decision analysis processes that surround such conflicts.[203] In France, the use of acoustic fencing alongside TGV tracks might not have been achieved without the 1970s controversy over aircraft noise.[204] In the UK, the CPRE has issued tranquillity maps since 1990.[205] Concorde was normally perceived as a privilege of the rich, but special circular or one-way (with return by other flight or ship) charter flights were arranged to bring a trip within the means of moderately well-off enthusiasts.[206] As a symbol of national pride, an example from the BA fleet made occasional flypasts at selected Royal events, major air shows and other special occasions, sometimes in formation with the Red Arrows.[207] On the final day of commercial service, public interest was so great that grandstands were erected at Heathrow Airport. Significant numbers of people attended the final landings; the event received widespread media coverage.[208] The aircraft was usually referred to by the British as simply \"Concorde\".[209] In France it was known as \"le Concorde\" due to \"le\", the definite article,[210] used in French grammar to introduce the name of a ship or aircraft,[211] and the capital being used to distinguish a proper name from a common noun of the same spelling.[210][212] In French, the common noun concorde means \"agreement, harmony, or peace\".[N 1] Concorde's pilots and British Airways in official publications often refer to Concorde both in the singular and plural as \"she\" or \"her\".[214] In 2006, 37 years after its first test flight, Concorde was announced the winner of the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC (through The Culture Show) and the Design Museum. A total of 212,000 votes were cast with Concorde beating other British design icons such as the Mini, mini skirt, Jaguar E-Type car, the Tube map, the World Wide Web, the K2 red telephone box and the Supermarine Spitfire.[215][216] The heads of France and the United Kingdom flew in Concorde many times.[217] Presidents Georges Pompidou,[218] Valéry Giscard d'Estaing[219] and François Mitterrand[220] regularly used Concorde as French flagship aircraft on foreign visits. Elizabeth II and Prime Ministers Edward Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair took Concorde in some charter flights such as the Queen's trips to Barbados on her Silver Jubilee in 1977, in 1987 and in 2003, to the Middle East in 1984 and to the US in 1991.[221] Pope John Paul II flew on Concorde in May 1989.[222] Concorde sometimes made special flights for demonstrations, air shows (such as the Farnborough, Paris-Le Bourget, Oshkosh AirVenture and MAKS air shows) as well as parades and celebrations (for example, of Zurich Airport's anniversary in 1998). The aircraft were also used for private charters (including by the President of Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko on multiple occasions),[223] for advertising companies (including for the firm OKI), for Olympic torch relays (1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville) and for observing solar eclipses, including the solar eclipse of 30 June 1973[224][225] and again for the total solar eclipse on 11 August 1999.[226] The fastest transatlantic airliner flight was from New York JFK to London Heathrow on 7 February 1996, aided by a 175 mph (282 km/h) tailwind, by the British Airways G-BOAD, in 2 hours, 52 minutes, 59 seconds from take-off to touchdown.[227] On 13 February 1985, a Concorde charter flight flew from London Heathrow to Sydney in a time of 17 hours, 3 minutes and 45 seconds, including refuelling stops.[228][229] Concorde set the FAI \"Westbound Around the World\" and \"Eastbound Around the World\" world air speed records.[citation needed] On 12–13 October 1992, in commemoration of the 500th anniversary of Columbus' first voyage to the New World, Concorde Spirit Tours (US) chartered Air France Concorde F-BTSD and circumnavigated the world in 32 hours 49 minutes and 3 seconds, from Lisbon, Portugal, including six refuelling stops at Santo Domingo, Acapulco, Honolulu, Guam, Bangkok, and Bahrain.[230] The eastbound record was set by the same Air France Concorde (F-BTSD) under charter to Concorde Spirit Tours[225] in the US on 15–16 August 1995. This promotional flight circumnavigated the world from New York/JFK International Airport in 31 hours 27 minutes 49 seconds, including six refuelling stops at Toulouse, Dubai, Bangkok, Andersen AFB in Guam, Honolulu, and Acapulco.[231] On its way to the Museum of Flight in November 2003, G-BOAG set a New York City-to-Seattle speed record of 3 hours, 55 minutes, and 12 seconds. Due to the restrictions on supersonic overflights within the US the flight was granted permission by the Canadian authorities for the majority of the journey to be flown supersonically over sparsely populated Canadian territory.[232] Data from The Wall Street Journal,[233] The Concorde Story,[234] The International Directory of Civil Aircraft,[73] Aérospatiale/BAC Concorde 1969 Onwards (All Models)[235] General characteristics Performance Avionics"}

It performed the longest observation of a solar eclipse to date, about 74 minutes.[5] Scheduled flights began on 21 January 1976 on the London–Bahrain and Paris–Rio de Janeiro (via Dakar) routes,[6] with BA flights using the Speedbird Concorde call sign to notify air traffic control of the aircraft's unique abilities and restrictions, but the French using their normal call signs.[7] The Paris-Caracas route (via Azores) began on 10 April. The US Congress had just banned Concorde landings in the US, mainly due to citizen protest over sonic booms, preventing launch on the coveted North Atlantic routes. The US Secretary of Transportation, William Coleman, gave permission for Concorde service to Dulles International Airport, and Air France and British Airways simultaneously began a thrice-weekly service to Dulles on 24 May 1976.[8] Due to low demand, AF cancelled its Washington service in October 1982, while BA cancelled it in November 1994.[9] When the US ban on JFK Concorde operations was lifted in February 1977, New York banned Concorde locally. The ban came to an end on 17 October 1977 when the Supreme Court of the United States declined to overturn a lower court's ruling rejecting efforts by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and a grass-roots campaign led by Carol Berman to continue the ban.[10] Despite complaints about noise, the report noted that Air Force One, at the time a Boeing VC-137, was louder than Concorde at subsonic speeds and during takeoff and landing.[11] Scheduled service from Paris and London to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport began on 22 November 1977.[12] In December 1977, BA and Singapore Airlines started sharing a Concorde for flights between London and Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar via Bahrain. The aircraft, BA's Concorde G-BOAD, was painted in Singapore Airlines livery on the left side and BA livery on the right side.[13][14] The service was discontinued after three return flights because of noise complaints from the Malaysian government;[15][failed verification] it could only be reinstated on a new route bypassing Malaysian airspace in 1979. A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace, so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in 1980.[16] During the Mexican oil boom, AF flew Concorde twice weekly to Mexico City's Mexico City International Airport via Washington, DC, or New York City, from September 1978 to November 1982.[17][18] The worldwide economic crisis during that period resulted in this route's cancellation; the last flights were almost empty. The routing between Washington or New York and Mexico City included a deceleration, from Mach 2.02 to Mach 0.95, to cross Florida subsonically and avoid creating a sonic boom over the state; Concorde then re-accelerated back to high speed while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 April 1989, on an around-the-world luxury tour charter, BA implemented changes to this routing that allowed G-BOAF to maintain Mach 2.02 by passing around Florida to the east and south. Periodically Concorde visited the region on similar chartered flights to Mexico City and Acapulco.[citation needed] From December 1978 to May 1980, Braniff International Airways leased 11 Concordes, five from AF and six from BA.[19] These were used on subsonic flights between Dallas–Fort Worth and Dulles International Airport, flown by Braniff flight crews.[20] AF and BA crews then took over for the continuing supersonic flights to London and Paris.[21] The aircraft were registered in both the United States and their home countries; the European registration was covered while being operated by Braniff, retaining full AF/BA liveries. The flights were not profitable and typically less than 50% booked, forcing Braniff to end its tenure as the only US Concorde operator in May 1980.[22][23] In its early years, BA's Concorde service had a greater number of \"no-shows\" (passengers who booked a flight and then failed to appear at the gate for boarding) than any other aircraft in the fleet.[24] Following the launch of British Airways Concorde services, Britain's other major airline, British Caledonian (BCal), set up a task force headed by Gordon Davidson, BA's former Concorde director, to investigate the possibility of their own Concorde operations.[25][26][27] This was seen as particularly viable for the airline's long-haul network as there were two unsold aircraft then available for purchase.[28][29][30] One important reason for BCal's interest in Concorde was that the British Government's 1976 aviation policy review had opened the possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence. To counteract this potential threat, BCal considered their own independent Concorde plans, as well as a partnership with BA.[31][32] BCal were considered most likely to have set up a Concorde service on the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue and profits within BCal's scheduled route network;[33][34] BCal's Concorde task force did assess the viability of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route.[29][32][35] BCal entered into a bid to acquire at least one Concorde.[28][30][35] However, BCal eventually arranged for two aircraft to be leased from BA and Aérospatiale respectively, to be maintained by either BA or AF. BCal's envisaged two-Concorde fleet would have required a high level of aircraft usage to be cost-effective; therefore, BCal had decided to operate the second aircraft on a supersonic service between Gatwick and Atlanta, with a stopover at either Gander or Halifax.[29] Consideration was given to services to Houston and various points on its South American network at a later stage.[35][36] Both supersonic services were to be launched at some point during 1980; however, steeply rising oil prices caused by the 1979 energy crisis led to BCal shelving their supersonic ambitions.[32] By around 1981 in the UK, the future for Concorde looked bleak. The British government had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down. Despite this, the government was not keen to continue. In 1983, BA's managing director, Sir John King, convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to the then state-owned British Airways for 16.5 million (US$25.01 million) plus the first year's profits.[37][38] In 2003, in a radio interview with Alan Robb on BBC Radio 5 Live, Lord Heseltine, the minister then responsible, acknowledged that the plane was sold \"next to nothing\" and agreed the deal was among the most disastrous conducted by a government minister; \"but if you have your hands tied behind your back and no cards and a very skilful negotiator on the other side of the table... I defy you to do any [better].\"[39] Its estimated operating costs were $3,800 per block hour in 1972 (equivalent to $28,565 in 2024), compared to actual 1971 operating costs of $1,835 for a 707 and $3,500 for a 747 (equivalent to $14,247 and $27,175, respectively); for a 3,050 nmi (5,650 km) London–New York sector, a 707 cost $13,750 or 3.04¢ per seat/nmi (in 1971 dollars), a 747 $26,200 or 2.4¢ per seat/nmi and Concorde $14,250 or 4.5¢ per seat/nmi.[40] On a transatlantic flight, having a cruising speed of more than double a B-707, Concorde required less than half the number of block hours per trip. This illustrates that these two aircraft types were designed for entirely different flight regimes (subsonic versus supersonic) and different markets, so a direct comparison is not possible. A more direct operating cost per seat mile would be against a subsonic first class seat while factoring twice the flight time as a cost increasing component.[41] In 1983, Pan Am accused the British Government of subsidising BA Concorde air fares, on which a return London–New York was £2,399 (£10,225 in 2023 prices), compared to £1,986 (£8,464) with a subsonic first class return, and London–Washington return was £2,426 (£10,340) instead of £2,258 (£9,624) subsonic.[42][43][44] However, by this time, Concorde was operating in its own P&L division with no subsidy available to it.[45] Concorde's unit cost was then $33.8 million[46] ($192 million in 2024 dollars[47]). BA and AF benefited from a significantly reduced purchase price from the manufacturing consortium via their respective governments.[48] After six years of on and off profitability, in 1982 Concorde was established in its own operating division (Concorde Division) under Capt. Brian Walpole and Capt. Jock Lowe.[49] Their research revealed that regular passengers thought that the fare was higher than it actually was (business travellers were the majority of passengers), so the airline raised ticket prices to match these perceptions[50][51][52][53] and, following the marketing research and repositioning, Concorde ran profitably for BA. The ticket price was pitched about 10–15% above subsonic first class (1996 £4,772 versus subsonic first class £4,314) adding to its corporate appeal and ensuring loyalty from regular users which brought regular load factors of around 80%. [54][55] Over the next twenty years, BA's Concordes earned over half a billion pounds in profit with (typically) just five aircraft operating and two in various maintenance cycles.[54][56] Air France and Interflug shared the same office building in Paris in the 1980s. Due to their socialistic persuasions, both of them developed kinships for each other. The Air France staff proposed limited Concorde service to Leipzig during the Leipziger Buchmesse (Leipzig book fair), carrying business people. The East German government agreed to allow the Concorde flights to Leipzig and made the special accommodations for the “friendship flights”. Klaus Henkes, the deputy transport minister and the former general director of Interflug, was one of the most powerful East German governmental officials, and he made the quick arrangements and granted the special flight certificate for the Concorde flights within East Germany.[57] The Yalta Conference of 1945 stipulated lot of restrictions about flying over East Germany to Berlin (West) from West Germany. Additionally, the stipulations did not allow the Allies-designated airways such as Air France to divert from one of three corridors to other aeroports in East Germany. Instead, Concorde entered East Germany from Baltic Sea via Denmark. Mr Henkes also allowed the Concorde to fly at Mach 1.5 over East Germany prior to arrival at Leipzig aeroport during its first flight as this specific route was designated as military flight practice with fighters flying at supersonic speed. The overland speed record by the passenger aeroplane over the European land remains unbroken to this day.[57][58] About 30,000 to 40,000 East Germans showed up at and around the aeroport along with many employees stopping their jobs to witness the momentous event of first Concorde landing on 18 March 1986.[57][59] Air France made the several flights during the Leipziger Buchmesse in the spring and autumn until 1990 while British Airways made a single return flight between London and Leipzig with its G-BOAF two days later on 20 March.[60][61] Leipzig aeroport remained the only one in the Communist Bloc that served Concorde and only one in Germany that received the frequent Concorde flights.[57][58] Between March 1984 and January 1991, BA flew a thrice-weekly Concorde service between London and Miami, stopping at Dulles International Airport.[62][63] Until 2003, AF and BA continued to operate the New York services daily. From 1987 to 2003, BA flew a Saturday morning Concorde service to Grantley Adams International Airport, Barbados, during the summer and winter holiday season.[64][65] Prior to the crash of Air France Flight 4590, several UK and French tour operators operated charter flights to European destinations on a regular basis;[66][67] the charter business was viewed as lucrative by BA and AF.[68] Air France staged two special round-the-world Concorde flights in 1992 and 1995. The first, dubbed Flight 1492 and performed on 12–13 October 1992 to mark the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' first voyage to the Americas, circled the globe in 32 hours and 49 minutes, setting a new world record for the fastest non-orbital circumnavigation of the Earth.[69] The second flight, on 15–16 August 1995, improved this record by circumnavigating the Earth in 31 hours and 27 minutes. The 1995 record still stands as the fastest non-orbital circumnavigation in history.[70][71] In 1997, BA held a promotional contest to mark the 10th anniversary of the airline's move into the private sector. The promotion was a lottery to fly to New York held for 190 tickets valued at £5,400 each, to be offered at £10. Contestants had to call a special hotline to compete with up to 20 million people.[72] On 25 July 2000, Air France Concorde F-BTSC crashed during takeoff from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, killing all 109 people on board and 4 on the ground. It was the first fatal accident in the Concorde's history. Investigations of the accident determined that the plane had run over a small piece of metal debris on the runway during its takeoff roll, puncturing one of its front tyres. Part of the burst tyre then hit the plane's fuselage, causing one of its fuel tanks to rupture. The burning plane was already moving too quickly to abort takeoff, but it could not climb or accelerate, and it crashed into a nearby hotel. The Concorde was vulnerable to such accidents because of its high takeoff speed, and at least seven previous incidents involving burst tyres had caused serious damage to Concordes. The week before the Flight 4590 accident, British Airways grounded one of its Concordes, G-BOAE, after discovering a 66-millimetre-long (2.6 in) crack in an internal cross-beam of the plane's wing.[73] On 23 July, BA disclosed that similar but smaller cracks had been discovered in all seven of its Concordes, but the airline said that the defects were not in \"a safety-critical part of the plane\" and did not ground the rest of the fleet.[74] Aérospatiale said that cracks up to 50 millimetres (2.0 in) in length were safe.[73] On 24 July, the day before the fatal accident, Air France disclosed that it had discovered similar cracks in four of its six Concordes.[75] F-BTSC, the Concorde destroyed in the next day's crash, was one of the two that did not have this defect, and investigators quickly concluded that such cracks could not have played a role in the disaster.[76] Immediately after the Flight 4590 crash, Air France grounded the rest of its Concorde fleet while an investigation was carried out. British Airways cancelled all Concorde flights that evening,[77] but after an inspection of its fleet, BA decided to resume Concorde service on 26 July.[78] The preliminary results of the French investigation, finding that the bursting of a single tyre had caused the accident, were known within weeks of the crash. Based on these findings, the British Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) informed British Airways on 15 August that it was preparing to revoke the Concorde's certificate of airworthiness the next day. At the time the notice was received, Concorde G-BOAB was preparing for takeoff on a runway at Heathrow; BA promptly recalled the plane to the gate and disembarked all passengers, although the crew was allowed to fly the plane to New York as scheduled.[79] Both airlines planned to improve the safety of the aircraft rather than retire the Concorde. British Airways used G-BOAF, commonly known as \"Alpha Foxtrot\", to test modifications intended to prevent further accidents. These changes included Kevlar linings for the plane's fuel tanks, armour-plating around crucial electrical and hydraulic systems, and stronger tyres. The first test flight of the reinforced G-BOAF took place on 17 July 2001, leaving Heathrow Airport to the west, turning around near Iceland, and landing at RAF Brize Norton near London.[80] Air France carried out the first test flight of its similarly modified Concorde F-BVFB on 24 August.[81] These tests were declared successful, and on 5 September 2001, the British CAA and the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation each issued a \"mandatory airworthiness directive\", allowing Concordes to return to passenger service as long as they were modified as G-BOAF and F-BVFB had been.[82] BA carried out the first Concorde flight with passengers on 11 September, although all of these passengers were BA employees engaging in a dress rehearsal of a normal commercial flight. G-BOAF took off from Heathrow at 10:30 BST, turned around halfway across the Atlantic, and landed back at Heathrow at about 13:50 – almost exactly the same time that the September 11 attacks began in New York City.[83][84] Commercial passenger service on the Concorde resumed on 7 November 2001. Air France Flight 2, F-BTSD, left Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport at its normal departure time, 10:30 CET, and landed at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport at 08:20 EST. British Airways Flight 1, G-BOAE, left London Heathrow one hour later at 10:30 GMT and arrived at JFK at 09:10 EST. The airlines had attempted to synchronize a simultaneous departure, as had been done at the beginning of revenue service in 1976, but airport scheduling made this impractical. British prime minister Tony Blair flew G-BOAF later that day from Heathrow to Washington, D.C., for a summit with U.S. president George W. Bush.[81][85] On 10 April 2003, Air France and British Airways simultaneously announced they would retire Concorde later that year.[86] They cited low passenger numbers following the 25 July 2000 crash, the slump in air travel following the September 11 attacks, and rising maintenance costs: Airbus, the company that acquired Aérospatiale in 2000, had made a decision in 2003 to no longer supply replacement parts for the aircraft.[87][88][89] Concorde was technologically advanced when introduced in the 1970s, and while in 2003, its analogue cockpit may have appeared outdated, an upgrade was not necessary or a regulatory requirement, as it was still contemporary with other aircraft such as the Boeing 747-300 in service at the time. British Airways had completed patterning of replacement avionics spares with modern avionics equivalents and so had access to the necessary spares it needed to continue operations. The airframes had undergone a life extension survey that proved them to be in better than expected condition[90] with the same number of flight cycles as an average 7 year old B-737 and BA, in conjunction with BAe and Aerospatiale, (dubbed Concorde Relife Group), had the airframe certified for continued operation until 2014/15.[91] There had been little commercial pressure to upgrade Concorde due to its low flight cycles, a lack of competing aircraft and the fact that the aircraft remained sustainably profitable in its current configuration. By its retirement, it was the last aircraft in the British Airways fleet that had a flight engineer.[92] On 11 April 2003, Virgin Atlantic founder Sir Richard Branson announced that the company was interested in purchasing BA's Concorde fleet \"for the same price that they were given them for – one pound\".[93][94] BA dismissed the idea, prompting Virgin to increase their offer to £1 million each.[95][96] Branson claimed that when BA was privatised, a clause in the agreement required them to allow another British airline to operate Concorde if BA ceased to do so, but the Government denied the existence of such a clause.[97] In October 2003, Branson wrote in The Economist that his final offer was \"over £5 million\" and that he had intended to operate the fleet \"for many years to come\".[98] UK Civil Aviation Authority regulatory requirements would have only allowed Virgin Atlantic to add Concorde to its Air Operator Certificate after it demonstrated the engineering and aircrew expertise necessary to operate and sustain it.[99] It has been suggested that Concorde was not withdrawn for the reasons usually given but that it became apparent during the grounding of Concorde that the airlines could make more profit carrying first-class passengers subsonically.[100] A lack of commitment to Concorde from Director of Engineering Alan MacDonald may have undermined BA's resolve to continue operating Concorde.[101] Other reasons why the attempted revival of Concorde never happened relate to the fact that the narrow fuselage did not allow for \"luxury\" features of subsonic air travel such as moving space, reclining seats and overall comfort.[102] In the words of The Guardian's Dave Hall, \"Concorde was an outdated notion of prestige that left sheer speed the only luxury of supersonic travel.\"[102] Air France made its final commercial Concorde landing in the United States in New York City from Paris on 30 May 2003.[103][104] AF's final Concorde flight took place on 27 June 2003 when F-BVFC retired to Toulouse.[105] An auction of Concorde parts and memorabilia for AF was held at Christie's in Paris on 15 November 2003; 1,300 people attended, and several lots exceeded their predicted values.[106] French Concorde F-BVFC was retired to Toulouse and kept functional for a short time after the end of service, in case taxi runs were required in support of the French judicial enquiry into the 2000 crash. The aircraft is now fully retired and no longer functional.[107] AF Concorde F-BTSD was retired to the \"Musée de l'Air\" at Paris–Le Bourget Airport near Paris; unlike the other museum Concordes, a few of the systems are kept functional. For instance, the \"droop nose\" can still be lowered and raised. This led to rumours that they could be prepared for future flights for special occasions.[108] AF Concorde F-BVFB is at the Auto & Technik Museum Sinsheim at Sinsheim, Germany, after its last flight from Paris to Baden-Baden, followed by transport to Sinsheim via barge and road. The museum also has a Tupolev Tu-144 on display – this is the only place where both supersonic airliners can be seen together.[109] In 1989, AF signed a letter of agreement to donate a Concorde to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. upon the aircraft's retirement. On 12 June 2003, AF honoured that agreement, donating Concorde F-BVFA (serial 205) to the museum upon the completion of its last flight. This aircraft was the first AF Concorde to open service to Rio de Janeiro, Washington, D.C., and New York and had flown 17,824 hours. It is on display at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles International Airport.[110] British Airways conducted a North American farewell tour in October 2003. G-BOAG visited Toronto Pearson International Airport on 1 October, after which it flew to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.[111] G-BOAD visited Boston's Logan International Airport on 8 October, and G-BOAG visited Dulles International Airport on 14 October.[112] In a week of farewell flights around the United Kingdom, Concorde visited Birmingham on 20 October, Belfast on 21 October, Manchester on 22 October, Cardiff on 23 October, and Edinburgh on 24 October. Each day the aircraft made a return flight out and back into Heathrow to the cities, often overflying them at low altitude.[113][114] On 22 October, both Concorde flight BA9021C, a special from Manchester, and BA002 from New York landed simultaneously on both of Heathrow's runways. On 23 October 2003, the Queen consented to the illumination of Windsor Castle, an honour reserved for state events and visiting dignitaries, as Concorde's last west-bound commercial flight departed London.[115] BA retired its Concorde fleet on 24 October 2003.[4] G-BOAG left New York to a fanfare similar to that given for AF's F-BTSD, while two more made round trips, G-BOAF over the Bay of Biscay, carrying VIP guests including former Concorde pilots, and G-BOAE to Edinburgh. The three aircraft then circled over London, having received special permission to fly at low altitude, before landing in sequence at Heathrow. The captain of the New York to London flight was Mike Bannister.[116] The final US Concorde flight occurred on 5 November 2003 when G-BOAG flew from New York's JFK Airport to Seattle's Boeing Field to join the Museum of Flight's permanent collection, piloted by Mike Bannister and Les Broadie, who claimed a flight time of three hours, 55 minutes and 12 seconds, a record between the two cities that was made possible by Canada granting use of a supersonic corridor between Chibougamau, Quebec, and Peace River, Alberta.[117] The museum had been pursuing a Concorde for their collection since 1984.[118] The final Concorde flight worldwide took place on 26 November 2003 with G-BOAF carrying 100 BA cabin crew members and pilots out over the Bay of Biscay and going supersonic over the Atlantic followed by a fly-past over Bristol Filton Airport before landing there in front of a crowd of more than 20,000 people.[119] BA's Concorde fleet have been grounded, drained of hydraulic fluid and their airworthiness certificates withdrawn. Jock Lowe, ex-chief Concorde pilot and manager of the fleet, estimated in 2004 that it would cost £10–15 million to make G-BOAF airworthy again.[108] BA maintain ownership and have stated that they will not fly again due to a lack of support from Airbus.[120] On 1 December 2003, Bonhams held an auction of British Airways Concorde artefacts, including a nose cone, at Kensington Olympia in London.[121][122] Proceeds of around £750,000 were raised, with the majority going to charity. G-BOAD is currently on display at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York.[123] In 2007, BA announced that the advertising spot at Heathrow where a 40% scale model of Concorde was located would not be retained; the model is now on display at the Brooklands Museum, in Surrey.[124]"}
